                18 May 2022Your Excellencies Heads of State and International Organizations,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Good evening. It is a great pleasure to meet you all online. To begin with, I wish to offer my warmest congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and a sincere welcome to all guests attending the Global Trade and Investment Promotion Summit. I also wish to express our heartfelt appreciation and best regards to friends from all walks of life at home and overseas for your longstanding care and support to China’s reform, opening-up and modernization efforts.Founded in 1952 as a China-based institution with a global outlook, the CCPIT has been playing an important role in strengthening the bond of interest between Chinese and foreign businesses, promoting international economic and trade exchanges, and facilitating state-to-state relations. True to its founding mission of serving Chinese and foreign businesses, the Council has worked to promote trade and investment and advance China’s institutional opening-up. It has explored innovations in international economic and trade arbitration, intellectual property right services, and commercial mediation, among others. It has kept up close ties with business communities across countries, provided platforms and opportunities for trade and economic cooperation between China and the rest of the world, and contributed to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. The 70-year journey of the CCPIT has been an epitome of China’s ever-expanding opening-up endeavor, and an important witness of how businesses from different countries could share in development opportunities and benefit from win-win cooperation.It is my hope that the Council will continue to break new ground with its tradition of excellence, strengthen its service network for businesses, expand its international circle of friends, and score still greater achievements in contributing to high-quality development and a new development paradigm in China and to an open world economy.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Our world is facing a pandemic and drastic changes both unseen in a century. Economic globalization is experiencing headwinds, and the world is entering a new period of volatility and transformation. Now more than ever, business communities across the world yearn for peace and development, call for fairness and justice, and aspire for win-win cooperation. For this to happen, I would advise efforts on the following four fronts.First, we need to pull together to defeat COVID-19. The pandemic has been going on unabated. Resurging with ever faster transmission, it is posing a serious threat to the life and health of the people, and taking a heavy toll on the world economy. We must put people and their lives first, actively engage in international cooperation on vaccine R&D, production and distribution, bolster global public health governance, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the virus, and work for a global community of health for all.Second, we need to reinvigorate trade and investment. We need to balance pandemic response and economic development, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination across countries, and get the global economy out of the woods at an early date. China has put forward a Global Development Initiative, which calls for concerted efforts to advance the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in all respects. We need to help the global economy upgrade its growth drivers, shift its growth model and adjust its structure so as to steer it onto a track of long-term, healthy and stable growth. We should support the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime, ensure security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and make the “pie” of cooperation bigger to allow development gains to better trickle down to people of all countries.Third, we need to unleash the power of innovation in driving development. We should tap into the potential of innovation in spurring growth, jointly step up intellectual property protection, make rules on the basis of extensive participation and consensus building, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological development. We should intensify exchanges and cooperation on innovation, facilitate integration of science and technology with economic growth, increase the sharing of innovation results, and remove all barriers that hamper the flow of knowledge, technology, talent and other factors of innovation. By doing so, we will better unleash the gushing vitality of innovation.Fourth, we need to improve on global governance. In today’s world, the future of all countries is closely linked. Seeking exclusive blocs will only lead the world to division and confrontation. We should uphold true multilateralism, embrace a global governance vision featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and mobilize resources from across the world to meet global challenges and advance global development. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, tear down walls rather than erect walls, pursue integration instead of decoupling, opt for inclusiveness, not exclusion, and guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice.I wish to reiterate that China’s resolve to open up at a high standard will not change, and that the door of China will open still wider to the world. China will continue to foster an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards. We will pursue high-standard implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement and high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and offer more market, investment and growth opportunities to the global business community.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Let us join hands to uphold peace, development, cooperation and win-win partnership, work together to meet the problems facing the global economy, trade and investment, and jointly usher in an even brighter future.To conclude, I wish the Conference a full success.
                

                By Yang Jiechi (People's Daily Online) 09:02, May 16, 2022ISince the beginning of this year, faced with the complex situation where major global changes unseen in a century have been compounded by a once-in-a-century pandemic, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has taken into account both the domestic and international imperatives, worked on development and security as two top priorities, coordinated progress in COVID-19 response and in economic and social development, and observed and responded to international vicissitudes with calm and composure. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we have forged ahead on all fronts with unity and fortitude, fully implemented the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, and advanced work in various fields in a deep-going way. A series of new and important achievements have been made in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Following the fundamental guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in our external work and continuously advancing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, China has maintained its initiative and advantageous position in the overarching strategic context.In February and March this year, we overcame various difficulties and challenges, including those related to COVID-19, and successfully hosted the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games which attracted worldwide attention. With around 170 official representatives from nearly 70 countries and international organizations attending, close to 3,000 athletes from around 90 countries and regions competing, and billions of people around the world watching and setting the record for Winter Olympics ratings, a strong momentum was created in the international community against the politicization of sport, and the sinister attempts by anti-China forces to sabotage the Games and use the occasion to contain and suppress China were completely thwarted. During the Games, head-of-state diplomacy and home-ground diplomacy were conducted extensively. These diplomatic engagements fully demonstrated China’s confidence and openness as well as its commitment as a major country to resolutely promoting world peace and development. They also contributed greatly to building international consensus among the people of all countries for peace, friendship, unity, cooperation, civilizational progress and a shared future, injecting confidence and hope into a turbulent and unstable world.In March, we successfully convened the annual sessions of the National People’s Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, which smoothly completed all agenda items. They fully reflected the common aspirations of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and pooled enormous strength for advancing the cause of the Party and the country and for setting out on a new journey with confidence. They marked a new chapter of democracy, unity, truth-seeking and enterprise, and demonstrated once again to the world the institutional strength and unique advantage of China’s whole-process people’s democracy.Since the beginning of this year, tested by rising complexity and uncertainty in the external environment, the CPC Central Committee, with strategic vision and sound decision-making, has introduced in a timely way a series of policies conducive to economic and social stability and development. The Chinese economy kicked off to a steady start this year. Production on the supply side and market on the demand side have generally remained stable. People’s livelihoods have been protected with robust and effective steps. New progress has been made in achieving high-quality development. All this speaks volumes about China’s resilience against economic shocks and our country’s great vitality and dynamism. In the first quarter, China’s GDP grew by 4.8 percent year-on-year, ranking in the front among the major economies of the world and remaining a primary driver for global growth. From January to April, the total volume of import and export grew by 11.2 percent and paid-in foreign investment by 20.5 percent year-on-year, which serves as a clear indication that China continued to open wider to the world. With China’s contribution, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement has come into effect on schedule, marking the official launch of the world’s most promising free trade area covering the largest population and boasting the most diverse membership. From January to April, trade between China and other RCEP countries registered 3.84 trillion yuan, an increase of 3.9 percent from the same period of 2021. ASEAN has remained China’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade reaching 1.84 trillion yuan, up by 7.2 percent year-on-year. Trade between China and other Asian countries has also maintained a sound momentum of growth. International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank all expressed the belief that China has ample policy space to boost the economy, and the future holds out still greater prospects.Faced with a new wave of resurgence of COVID-19 cases worldwide, China has remained committed to putting the people and their lives first, to the prevention of both imported cases and domestic rebound, and to following a dynamic zero-COVID policy. We have been constantly fine-tuning our response measures in light of the evolving situation. Such efforts have brought about major strategic gains in our COVID-19 response and provided strong protection for the life and health of the 1.4 billion Chinese people. Our approach to COVID-19 response is determined by the very nature and mission of the Chinese Communist Party. Science-based and effective, it has underpinned the sound momentum in our economic and social development and earned firm endorsement from the Chinese people as well as high recognition from the mainstream of the international community. With a sense of responsibility toward the life and health of people across the world and solidarity with all countries in pulling together to tide over the difficult times, China has supplied more than 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations, and will further donate 600 million doses to African countries and 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. China has both adopted solid, vigorous, successful and responsible measures in its COVID-19 response to safeguard the people’s lives, and made tangible and sustained input to honor its solemn commitment to building a global community of health for all. China’s approach stands in stark contrast with the practice of some people in the West who have no regard for facts and confound black with white on COVID-related issues. We have every confidence in winning the tough battle against COVID-19, and will make an even greater contribution to the global solidarity and fight against the pandemic.Faced with a complex and turbulent global landscape, China’s foreign-related work continues to break the waves and forge ahead. Head-of-state diplomacy provides comprehensive guidance for China’s overall external work. General Secretary Xi Jinping has had in-depth communications and exchanges with foreign leaders and heads of international organizations, giving a tremendous boost to China’s foreign relations under the new circumstances. General Secretary Xi Jinping attended and addressed the annual session of the Davos World Economic Forum via video link and gave a keynote speech by video to the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, elaborating on China’s propositions under the new circumstances on such major issues as building a community with a shared future for mankind, COVID-19 response, economic recovery, global security and Asian cooperation, and making a vigorous effort to chart the correct direction for the development of the global order. Other Party and State leaders also engaged in active external interactions. We have worked intensively in such priority areas as major countries, neighboring countries, developing countries and multilateral institutions, in an effort to continuously consolidating and developing China’s global partnerships. We have resolutely pushed back the attempts of a few countries to interfere in China’s domestic affairs and to provoke or pressure China through issues concerning Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, maritime affairs and human rights, thus demonstrating our steadfast resolve and strong confidence in safeguarding our country’s sovereignty, security and development interests. We have stepped up our holistic approach to the Ukraine crisis, explained our clear policy stance based on the merits of the matter, played an independent and constructive role, proposed ways to resolve the crisis, put forward China’s initiative on preventing a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, and debunked and rebutted the various wrongful rhetoric and unfounded accusations against China. In so doing, we have spoken up for justice in the international arena, performed our responsibilities, firmly upheld fairness and equity, and won extensive understanding and recognition from the majority of countries, particularly the vast number of developing countries.The key to securing these achievements lies in the wise decision-making by General Secretary Xi Jinping and the CPC Central Committee, and the correct guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, as well as the concerted and dedicated efforts of our Party, armed forces and all Chinese people. Certain countries, harboring the strategic goal of containing China, have chosen to ignore China’s remarkable achievements and outstanding contribution to international peace and development. Instead, they have proceeded from their cold war mentality and ideological bias, gone out of their way to spread disinformation in order to smear and attack China, shown great interest in putting together various gatherings to embolden themselves and seek selfish gains, and created bloc confrontation by ganging up in small circles, all in an attempt to sabotage security and stability in China’s periphery and undermine China’s core and major interests. Their schemes will never succeed. What has happened shows that we have firmly grasped the overarching trend of global development and the right direction of history. We also have the five strategic conditions in our favor, namely the strong leadership of the CPC, the significant institutional strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the solid foundation laid by China’s sustained and fast development, long-term and enduring social stability, and a powerful drive that fills us with confidence and strength. Any conspiracy aimed at delaying or obstructing China’s development and growth is doomed to fail. The goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will definitely be realized.IIIn the face of new characteristics of the international situation and new features of China’s external environment, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of important new thoughts, propositions and initiatives, providing a guide to action for steering the major changes of the world in the right direction, resolving the international security dilemma, realizing common development around the world, safeguarding people’s lives and health, and upholding true multilateralism.In response to the accelerated evolution of the profound changes that are taking the world into a new period of instability and transformation, General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that changes of the world, of our times and of history are unfolding in ways like never before. These changes are posing challenges that must be taken seriously by humanity. Countries need to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, move in the right direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and rise to challenges and build a bright future through cooperation. The present and the immediate future will be a critical phase for the sustained progress toward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and for the profound evolution of changes in the world. New problems and challenges in the international landscape may spur complex changes, both predictable and unpredictable. Yet in every challenge lies an opportunity. The key is how to seize opportunities and turn challenges into opportunities. Certain countries have tried to deflect problems by causing chaos in the world, or to reverse the trend of the times by creating countercurrents. Such attempts to turn back the wheel of history can in no way alter the fundamental direction of the evolving world. We shall gain a deeper understanding of the major changes taking place in the world. We shall work with all countries toward a community with a shared future for mankind as we strive to promote the historical process of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we shall defend China’s long-term and fundamental interests as we adapt to, steer and shape major changes in the world.In light of the need to meet common challenges facing our world and promote security for all, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI), highlighting security as the precondition for development. We humanity are living in an indivisible security community. We should stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, take the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, resolve differences and disputes between countries peacefully through dialogue and consultation, and maintain security in both traditional and non-traditional domains. Right now, in the international situation, the medium- to long-term trends are interlaced with the features of this particular stage. Some countries have yet to renounce their cold war mentality; hegemonism and power politics remain entrenched; unilateralism and protectionism raise their heads from time to time; and security risks that arise from structural problems of various kinds flare up now and then. We should uphold the new vision on security and oppose all forms of hegemonic and bullying acts, oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries under whatever pretexts, oppose overstretching the concept of national security to contain and suppress other countries, and oppose politicizing and weaponizing economic, scientific and technological issues. Countries should be encouraged to pursue a new path of state-to-state engagement featuring dialogue and partnership rather than confrontation or alliance.In response to the serious disruption to the process of global development, as evidenced by the first-time decline of the Human Development Index in 30 years, General Secretary Xi Jinping has continued to enrich and flesh out the Global Development Initiative (GDI), emphasizing that no matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro policies, implement the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seriously eroded the gains in the global poverty reduction endeavor. Problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault lines and a technological divide have become more acute; risks and challenges for keeping global industrial and supply chains stable are many; and policy adjustments in some countries have produced serious, negative spillovers. We should work for an open world economy and increase macro policy coordination to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive development in the world. We should encourage countries to always give top priority to bettering people’s lives when implementing policies, unveiling measures and taking actions. Due attention should be given to the pressing needs of developing countries and more cooperation is needed in such key areas as poverty reduction, food security, development financing and industrialization, in order to address uneven and inadequate development.On coordinating the COVID-19 response with economic and social development, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of major assessments and important observations, stressing that people’s lives and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress, that for humanity to score a final victory against the COVID-19 pandemic, more hard efforts are needed, and that confidence and solidarity represent the only sure path to defeating the pandemic. General Secretary Xi Jinping has also called on countries to support each other, better coordinate response measures and improve global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic and speed up efforts toward a global community of health for all. Currently, COVID-19 remains a serious global pandemic, and there is considerable uncertainty about its future development. Now is certainly not the time to sit down and relax. The pandemic has continued to evolve with its impact reaching every aspect of the international political and economic dynamics and the social activities of all countries, and some in the West have used the pandemic to make unfounded accusations against China and to vilify and attack China’s social system. We must stay level-headed, unswervingly adhere to our dynamic zero-COVID policy, and resolutely counter any rhetoric or action aimed at distorting, challenging or discrediting China’s COVID-19 response policy. At the same time, we need to encourage all countries to step up international cooperation against the pandemic, put up multiple lines of defense, close the global immunization gap, and oppose the rhetoric and practice of holding each other back or shifting blame, all in an effort to jointly defend people’s lives and health.In response to the new challenges facing multilateralism and global governance, General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that attempts to single-mindedly build “small yards with high walls” or “parallel systems”, to form exclusive small circles or blocs that polarize the world, and to decouple, disrupt supply or exert maximum pressure will seriously undercut international efforts to tackle common challenges, underscoring the need to uphold true multilateralism and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law. In fact, the majority of countries in the world are strongly opposed to acts of fanning up cold war mentality and bloc confrontation, as they see clearly the nature of such excessive, selfish pursuit for hegemony under the disguise of democracy. We need to follow the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits in global governance, promote humanity’s common values, and encourage exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations. We need to champion greater democracy in international relations, increase the representation and voice of developing countries in global affairs, and work with the rest of the international community to tackle global challenges and reform and improve the global governance system.These major observations and important thoughts of General Secretary Xi Jinping have profoundly revealed the underlying trend of the evolving international landscape, demonstrated China’s sense of responsibility and commitment for working with all other countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind, and pointed the way forward for countries to maintain security and advance development in times of instability and transformation. They have been highly acclaimed and widely welcomed by the international community. Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, being ever enriching and developing, offers a fundamental guidance for us to analyze and understand the current international situation, and provides a powerful intellectual inspiration for China’s external work to forge ahead against all odds. China’s commitment to building a community with a shared future for mankind reflects an aspiration shared by people around the world. It represents the right direction of historical evolution, and serves as an important driving force that shapes the changing world. We must think and act in accordance with the important conclusions made by General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, foster a correct outlook on history, on the bigger picture and on the role of our country, and see through the phenomenon to grasp the essence and look beyond the present to seize long-term trends. We need to stick to the right direction, firm up strategic confidence, get a keen understanding of the principal contradiction and central tasks, take both strategic and tactical issues seriously, maintain a fighting spirit, and be brave and adept in carrying out our struggle. By doing so, we will foster new opportunities amidst crises and open up new horizons on a shifting landscape.IIIThis year, the CPC will convene its 20th National Congress. It is the overriding theme that will run through our work on all fronts for the entire year. In conducting our external work, we must study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy all the more comprehensively, systematically and thoroughly. We must keep in mind the overarching strategic context of the Chinese nation’s great rejuvenation and major changes unseen in a century in the world, hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and deliver a solid performance in external work across the board with a great sense of political responsibility and historical mission, to celebrate the successful opening of the 20th National Congress of the CPC with concrete actions and contribute our part to building a modern socialist country in all respects.First, we will take a coordinated approach to the domestic and international imperatives and enhance overall and systematic planning for external work. We will resolutely follow through on General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions on external work and the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, adhere to the strategic guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, and make good plans for and deliver good results in external work on all fronts and in all areas, to serve the central tasks of the Party and the country. We will make every effort to promote the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s major visions and initiatives, and work steadfastly to advance international solidarity and cooperation, uphold world peace and stability, and promote common development and prosperity. We will remove all external disruptions, forestall and defuse the various foreign-related emergencies, risks and challenges, and do all that is necessary to ensure overall development and stability at home.Second, we will continue to coordinate development and security priorities to better serve China’s development and national rejuvenation. We will firmly safeguard the dignity of the country as well as the security of our system and ideology, and ensure China’s overall political and social stability. On issues concerning Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet and maritime affairs, we will resolutely defend China’s core and major interests and thwart any attempt to undermine China’s territorial sovereignty and interfere in our internal affairs. We will fight to win the comprehensive, all-out war against COVID-19. While continuing to forestall imported cases in a targeted and effective manner, we will prudently engage in external exchanges and cooperation amid the pandemic. We will work with countries in the region to uphold peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, guard against risks and challenges of various sorts, and pursue steady and solid progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We will implement the new development philosophy fully, faithfully and across the board, stay committed to advancing openness and cooperation, promote smooth and dynamic domestic and international economic circulations, and create favorable conditions for high-quality development. Meanwhile, we will carry out in-depth study on issues relating to the economy, trade, technology, finance, energy, food and other fields, to hold the red line of no systemic risks or crises. We will take a coordinated approach to addressing traditional and non-traditional security threats, step up protection of the safety of Chinese citizens overseas, and enhance the level of protection of China’s interests abroad.Third, we will advance and improve the overall layout of China’s external work and strengthen our global network of partnerships. We will deepen coordination and cooperation with major countries and promote overall stability and balanced development of the international configuration. We will continue to move forward the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era. We will urge the United States to work with us in managing China-US relations in ways of staying committed to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation and properly managing differences. We will resolutely respond to any scheme, rhetoric or act by the US side to contain China or take China down. We will step up communication and mutual trust with the EU from a long-term perspective, and promote the shared commitment of the two sides to building partnerships for peace, growth, reform and civilization. We will vigorously advance the building of a community with a shared future with our neighbors, continue to cement mutual political trust and convergence of interests with neighboring countries, stay committed to high-quality implementation of the RCEP, work with ASEAN countries to advance consultations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea (COC) and dialogue and cooperation on maritime affairs, and firmly oppose acts by some people to deliberately provoke confrontation, spread disinformation and sabotage development and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific or China’s neighborhood. We will make continuous efforts to enhance solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and broaden and deepen friendly and cooperative relations with relevant regional organizations. On hot-spot issues such as the Ukraine crisis, the Korean Peninsula issue, the Iranian nuclear issue and Afghanistan, we will stand by our principled position, uphold fairness and justice and play our constructive role.Fourth, we will actively take part in and lead the reform and development of the global governance system, and champion and practice true multilateralism. We will stay committed to building a community with a shared future for mankind and to fostering a new type of international relations. We will firmly uphold the international system centered on the UN, resolutely oppose small circles based on cold war mentality and ideological bias, and work for a more fair and equitable international order. We will firmly support economic globalization, work to build an open world economy, and promote global macroeconomic policy coordination and trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We will actively support the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS countries in breaking new ground and achieving new progress in practical cooperation and institution building, and support multilateral mechanisms including the G20 and APEC in playing their due roles. We will work for sound implementation of the GDI and the GSI, advance the building of a global community of health for all, and take an active part in international governance initiatives related to climate change, cyberspace, the deep sea, the polar regions and outer space.Fifth, we will uphold the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee and further consolidate the synergized framework in which the CPC Central Committee exercises overall leadership and coordinates all aspects of external work. We will keep strictly in line with the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core in terms of our thinking, political orientation and action, and ensure that all directives are executed without fail and good coordination is maintained and that the centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee is followed in every dimension and phase of our external work. We will further coordinate foreign assistance, people-to-people diplomacy, foreign affairs at the subnational level and foreign-related rule of law, and actively carry out external exchanges on all fronts and in all fields in an orderly manner. We will encourage diverse cultural exchanges and activities, tell China’s stories in lively ways, and better present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China to the world. We will ensure that the campaign on studying the Party’s history is carried out on a regular and long-term basis to fully study and review the Party’s history and to inherit and carry forward the Party’s successful experience.In the historic journey toward realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we in the foreign service are entrusted with demanding tasks, lofty mission and important responsibilities. We must rally even more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, gain a thorough understanding of the decisive significance of establishing Comrade Xi Jinping’s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and establishing the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, further strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core and keep in alignment, enhance confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position in both the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole as well as the authority and centralized, unified leadership of the Party Central Committee. We must continue to enhance our capacity for political judgement, thinking and implementation, work with greater initiative and enthusiasm, and keep breaking new ground in China’s external work in the new era. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we will break the waves and surmount all challenges and difficulties, and will stride confidently toward realizing the Second Centenary Goal and contribute even more to the cause of peace, development and progress of humanity.
                

                Remarks by Wang YiState Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Heads of State Summit of the 15th Conference of the Parties of The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification9 May 2022Your Excellency President Alassane Ouattara,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,I am honored to attend, as the special representative of H.E. President Xi Jinping, the Heads of State Summit of the 15th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Thank you, President Alassane Ouattara, for your kind invitation. As we mark the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, we are gathered here in Africa to discuss the prevention and control of drought and desertification, which is of great significance for the development and vitalization of Africa and the sustainable development around the world.As land provides the material basis for humanity to survive and thrive, drought and desertification pose real threats to economic and social development of the affected regions. Over the past three decades, encouraging progress has been made in combating desertification, yet much remains to be done to achieve such global sustainable development goals as Land Degradation Neutrality. In particular, since the onset of COVID-19, developing countries have been grappling with serious challenges in economy and livelihood, and face a daunting task in balancing development and environmental protection. To break the vicious cycle of poverty and desertification, and truly achieve harmony between man and Nature, it is necessary for the international community to work collectively to find a solution. To this end, China has the following three proposals:First, we need to make solid efforts to strengthen international cooperation. Environmental issues are global challenges which require concerted efforts of all countries. Developing countries, especially African countries, face more severe challenges of drought and desertification, and the international community should lend a helping hand. China supports the adoption of the Abidjan Call by the meeting, and calls on developed countries to deliver on their commitments and provide strong support to developing countries in terms of funds and technology, among others. Key institutions such as UN agencies and the G20 should also channel more attention and support to this issue.Second, we need to take firm actions to promote green development. Combating desertification reduces poverty and contributes to prosperity. It is important to follow a new path of coordinating economic development and ecological restoration. Last year, President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI), which aims to achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development, and speed up the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Food security, climate governance and green development are key cooperation areas of the GDI, and drought mitigation and sustainable land governance are its inherent components. China welcomes the active participation of all parties to jointly write a new chapter of green development in a post-COVID world.Third, we need to take effective steps to improve international rules. The UNCCD is the main channel and key platform for the global fight against drought and desertification. It is important to actively address the concerns of African countries on drought, develop and improve rules on drought response, and foster a fair and equitable desertification governance system. We need to pay equal attention to rule-making in climate change, biodiversity and desertification control to pursue coordinated progress and form synergy.Ladies and Gentlemen,Our efforts to combat drought and desertification will benefit not only this generation, but many more to come. Under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has established the new development philosophy and advanced ecological conservation with the vision that clean waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver. Over the past decades, with solid and persistent efforts, China has achieved the historic transition from desert displacing human settlement to green oasis replacing desert, and has become one of the first countries to realize Land Degradation Neutrality. China has cultivated the world’s largest man-made forest in Saihanba, and created a China model by greening and transforming the vast desert in Kubuqi, Inner Mongolia. Meanwhile, we have taken an active part in international cooperation.  We have built, together with the UN, the International Training Center on Combating Desertification and the International Desertification Control Knowledge Management Center, and have unreservedly shared our experience with the international community.China feels for the pain of African countries and peoples as they suffer from drought and desertification. The map of global sustainable development would not be complete without Africa. A successful fight against desertification in Africa will provide a strong boost to the realization of the UN SDGs. China is committed to working for a green Belt and Road. Through such mechanisms as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and South-South cooperation, China is working with African countries toward the prospect of a green Africa. Last month, China held a capacity building symposium on supporting the Great Green Wall for African forestry experts. Going forward, we will continue to push forward the implementation of the nine programs of China-Africa cooperation including the green development program and the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change, and assist Africa in enhancing environmental governance capacity and promoting economic and social development.Ladies and Gentlemen,As ancient Chinese wisdom says, “The nation is well off when grass and trees thrive.” Let’s join hands in combating drought and desertification to jointly contribute to sustainable development and usher in a cleaner and more beautiful world together.I wish this meeting a full success.
                

                New York, 9 May 2022Your Excellency Secretary-General Guterres,Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Let me start by welcoming you to the High-Level Virtual Meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI).We meet at a time when the world is beset by global changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century. World economic recovery is facing headwinds. North-South gap keeps widening. Development cooperation is losing steam. And the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is facing unprecedented challenges. As Secretary-General Guterres rightly noted, now is the critical moment to “rescue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and get them back on track”.China is a member of the developing world, and always a good friend and good partner of all fellow developing countries. While striving to achieve its own development, China is committed to doing its best to help other developing countries achieve common development. Last September, President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI at the UN General Assembly. The purpose is to galvanize worldwide attention to development, strengthen global development partnership, promote international development cooperation, and lend fresh impetus to the realization of the 2030 SDGs.Since the very beginning, the GDI has been warmly received by the international community. More than 100 countries expressed support, and as many as 53 countries have joined the Group of Friends. This fully shows that the GDI responds to the call of the times, meets the needs of various countries, and reflects the trend of the world as well as the aspiration of the people.The GDI is committed to building political consensus on accelerating development. However the world may change, what remains unchanged is the yearning of the people of all countries for a better life and their desire and pursuit for development. This has added to the imperativeness and urgency of development. The GDI is designed to focus on development agenda, shore up political will, and help create a momentum that prioritizes development and advances cooperation.The GDI is committed to building a common platform for development cooperation. Global development needs clear visions and goals, and more important, practical actions and measures. Being action-oriented, the GDI aims to protect and improve livelihood, tackle the most urgent challenges in global development, and focus on key cooperation areas such as poverty reduction, COVID-19 response, human resource training, food and energy security, industrialization, digital economy and green development. This will provide useful avenues for parties to match their development needs and conduct project-based cooperation.The GDI is committed to promoting exchanges and mutual learning of development experience. In the course of their development, both developed and developing countries have accumulated rich experience. The GDI will facilitate the sharing and exchanges of different development experience, and support countries in exploring development paths within their national context and based on their strengths, with a view to eventually achieving common development.The GDI is committed to enhancing international synergy for coordinated development. To realize the SDGs, the UN has launched multiple processes that involve regional and sub-regional mechanisms and UN development agencies. The GDI will coordinate development cooperation at the global, regional and national levels to generate multiplier effect. And for all the 17 SDGs, the GDI will encourage international organizations, governments, businesses, the academia and civil societies to play their roles. The result will be a symphony for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.Colleagues,We all share deep conviction in multilateralism, unremitting pursuit of the 2030 Agenda, common concerns about the challenges to global development, and the same aspiration for progress of humanity. China proposes that all parties work together in four key areas for the GDI to deliver concrete results.First, re-energizing global cooperation on the 2030 Agenda. Implementation of the Agenda is the biggest consensus on global development, which offers the necessary pathway to addressing energy, food and other challenges of today. It should therefore continue to be a priority on the international cooperation agenda. All parties must honor their pledges and realize the 17 SDGs on schedule. We must oppose the politicization and marginalization of the development issue, continue to focus on the key areas most important to developing countries, and redouble our efforts to raise living standards across the world.Second, creating a favorable environment to accelerate global development. We need to improve the global governance system at a faster pace, increase the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries, and build an open world economy. It is important to uphold the right of people of all countries to choose their own development paths, and oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs and unilateral sanctions without basis in international law.Third, fostering equal and balanced global development partnership. Developed countries should fulfill their development assistance pledges and scale up support in financing and technology. Developing countries need to deepen South-South cooperation and realize leapfrog development. In the process, multilateral development institutions should provide more effective help to maximize synergy for development.Fourth, enabling the UN system to play the central and guiding role. We support the United Nations as the main coordinator in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We support the UN Secretary-General in making development a priority, mobilizing UN development agencies, and implementing the GDI to help achieve the SDGs. It is therefore necessary for the United Nations to advance institution-building for enhanced coordination. China is ready to support this through the China-UN Peace and Development Fund.Colleagues,China is a champion for global development, and more important, China is a practitioner of development cooperation. As the largest developing country, we always stand with other developing countries. We always commit ourselves to turning China’s growth into opportunities for the world. And we always take real actions to build a community with a shared future for mankind.China has given all-round support to other developing countries in reducing and alleviating poverty, improving livelihoods and building capacity for home-grown development. Over the past five decades, China has implemented several thousand complete projects and in-kind assistance programs, over 10,000 capacity building projects, and provided more than 400,000 training opportunities, benefiting over 160 fellow developing countries. This has strongly contributed to the global development cause.Going forward, China will take a host of practical measures to implement the GDI put forward by President Xi Jinping at an early date, and make new contribution to the global development cause.— China will enhance consultation with other emerging markets and developing countries, and hold a high-level meeting on global development at a proper time to discuss ways to promote development.— China will increase input in development, and further ramp up support for the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund and the China-UN Peace and Development Fund.— China will build on the consensus to establish a pool of GDI projects to be participated by all parties, and seek early harvest. UN agencies and members of the Group of Friends are welcome to put forward project proposals and contribute more wisdom and strength to GDI implementation.— China will release a Global Development Report in due time to promote international exchanges and sharing of development knowledge, support countries in exploring development paths suited to their national realities, and jointly enrich human knowledge on development.Colleagues,The GDI has demonstrated its strong vitality and broad prospects. We are ready to work with all parties to steadily advance the GDI, and make fresh contribution to implementing the 2030 Agenda, deepening cooperation on global development and building a community with a shared future for mankind!
                

                Wang YiState Councilor and Minister of Foreign AffairsChanges of the world, of our times and of history are unfolding today in ways like never before, posing challenges that must be taken seriously by humanity. At this moment critical to world peace and development, President Xi Jinping made a keynote speech entitled “Rising to Challenges and Building a Bright Future Through Cooperation” at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022, and proposed for the first time the Global Security Initiative (GSI). This important Initiative gives explicit answers to questions of our times such as what security concept the world needs and how countries can achieve common security. It fully demonstrates President Xi Jinping’s concerns for world peace and development, his internationalist vision, and his leadership as head of a major country. It contributes China’s wisdom to the efforts of mankind in tackling peace deficit, and offers China’s solution to addressing international security challenges.I. Understanding deeply GSI’s practical significance and its values to our timesThis major Initiative was proposed to meet the pressing need of the international community to maintain world peace and prevent conflicts and wars. Humanity has yet to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic, and the Ukraine crisis is already wreaking havoc. Various traditional and non-traditional security threats keep flaring up. Peace and development, the theme of our times, is faced with severe challenges. President Xi Jinping noted that peace is the ever-lasting wish of our people. Human history has proven time and again that without peace, development will be like water without source; without security, prosperity will be like trees without roots. The GSI is an effort to stand up to the changes of the world and answer the questions of the times. Building on the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, the GSI seeks to promote the establishment of a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. It thus offers a new approach to eliminating the root causes of international conflicts and achieving durable stability and security in the world.This major Initiative was proposed to meet the common aspirations of all countries to uphold multilateralism and international solidarity. The world today is facing unprecedented risks of division. Some countries, stubbornly clinging to the outdated mindset of Cold War confrontation, are obsessed with building exclusive, small circles and blocs. They pursue unilateralism in the name of multilateralism, use double standards while touting their own rules, and practice hegemony under the guise of democracy. These acts have seriously undermined the international security order and aggravated the deficit in global security governance. President Xi Jinping pointed out unequivocally that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century. The GSI is rooted in true multilateralism. It calls upon all countries to abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and reject the obsolete mentality of zero-sum game and bloc confrontation. It advocates the win-win mindset to address the complex and intertwined security challenges, and champions the spirit of solidarity to adapt to the profoundly changing international landscape. It has provided a new approach for improving global security governance. This major Initiative was proposed to meet the shared desire of all peoples for working together to overcome difficulties and build a better world beyond the pandemic. At present, global economic recovery remains sluggish, compounded by rising inflationary pressure and multiple crises on the financial, trade, energy, food and industrial- and supply-chain fronts. However, certain countries wantonly impose unilateral sanctions, exercise long-arm jurisdiction, insist on building “small yard, high fence” or “parallel systems”. They overstretch the concept of national security to hold back economic and technological advances of other countries. This has worsened the livelihoods of people all over the world, particularly those in developing countries. President Xi Jinping observed that countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable. The GSI echoes and reinforces the Global Development Initiative (GDI) proposed by President Xi Jinping last year. It accords with the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, and represents a coordinated approach to safeguarding traditional and non-traditional security. It aims to seek the biggest common denominator and the widest converging interests in the international community, and to provide new support for countries in boosting livelihoods and development. II. Getting a good grasp of the logical system and theoretical innovation of the GSIThe GSI is a complete system with rich meaning. It is the important fruit of applying Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy to the field of international security. It also improves and goes beyond the Western theory of geopolitical security. The GSI is underpinned by “six commitments”, namely, staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; staying committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; staying committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; staying committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; staying committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and staying committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains. These six commitments are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, including macro thinking of top-level design as well as methods and pathways for addressing practical issues. They form an organic whole of dialectical unity.The vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security serves as a guiding principle for maintaining world peace and tranquility. Since President Xi Jinping outlined this new vision on security at the Shanghai Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in 2014, it has been widely recognized and supported by the international community and has become a “golden key” for the world to reduce security deficit and tackle security challenges. Today, in a world faced with combined impacts of the pandemic and major changes both unseen in a century and the shadow of war and conflict, the significance of this new security vision is all the more evident. It will drive deep into people’s heart the idea of peace and cooperation, one about beating swords into plowshares and pursuing security for all. It will demonstrate the great potential of the new type of security that features dialogue, partnership and win-win instead of confrontation, alliance and a zero-sum approach.Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries is the basic prerequisite for maintaining world peace and tranquility. The principle of sovereignty is the cornerstone for norms governing international relations in contemporary times. All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. Their internal affairs brook no external interference, their sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and their rights to independently choose their social systems and development paths must be upheld. History has warned us repeatedly that claiming supremacy over others and the strong bullying the weak would cause instability, and that the law of the jungle and power politics would lead to conflict and chaos. In this fast-changing world, we must oppose hegemonic infringement on sovereignty and uphold sovereign independence and equality, so as to ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities and follow the same rules.Abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is the fundamental requirement for maintaining world peace and tranquility. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter are the result of deep soul-searching by people around the world on the bitter lessons of the two world wars. They embody humanity’s institutional design for achieving collective security and lasting peace. As President Xi Jinping noted, the various confrontation and injustice in the world today do not occur because the purposes and principles of the UN Charter are outdated, but because they are not effectively implemented. Going through major changes and the pandemic unseen in a century, we must act on true multilateralism, firmly reject unilateralism and all forms of fake multilateralism, firmly uphold the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and oppose all “gang rules” set by a few without UN authorization and at odds with the spirit of the UN Charter.Taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously is an important principle for maintaining world peace and tranquility. Humanity is an indivisible security community. Security of one country should not come at the expense of that of others, and security of a region cannot be ensured by strengthening or even expanding military blocs. All countries are equal and interdependent in terms of security interests. The legitimate and reasonable security concerns of any country should all be taken seriously and addressed properly, rather than being ignored all along or systemically challenged. An enduring solution to global security challenges lies in upholding the principle of indivisible security, taking each other’s legitimate security concerns seriously, and building a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture with a view to universal and common security.Resolving differences and disputes between countries peacefully through dialogue and consultation is the only path for maintaining world peace and tranquility. International practices have demonstrated fully that neither war nor sanction is a fundamental solution to disputes, and that dialogue and consultation are the most effective ways to resolve differences. The international community should unequivocally support all efforts conducive to peaceful settlement of crises, oppose attempts by any force to fan the flames or to obstruct and scupper peace talks. All parties should work in concert to defuse tensions, restore stability, promote peace, and encourage conflicting parties to engage in dialogue and keep the dialogue going so as to build trust, settle disputes and promote security through dialogue.Upholding both traditional and non-traditional security is an integral part of the cause of maintaining world peace and tranquility. With the deepening of economic globalization, the intension and extension of security are broadening to cover a much larger framework of time, space and areas. Security is becoming more interconnected, transnational and diverse. It thus necessitates continued creative thinking as well as keeping security cooperation in pace with the times. Facing complex international security threats such as regional disputes, terrorism, climate change and those related to cyber-security and bio-security, no country can stay unaffected or become a lone island. Only through working together to tide over the difficulties can countries turn pressure into driving forces and crises into opportunities.III. Inheriting and promoting the successful practices and valuable experience underpinning the GSIThe GSI takes root in New China’s independent foreign policy of peace and the practices of this policy. It is inspired by the diplomatic tradition and wisdom with unique Chinese characteristics. Over the years, as a responsible major country, China has held high the banner of peace, development and cooperation for win-win results, and made active contributions to upholding global peace and security, setting a prime example as a major country.China keeps to its conviction about peaceful development and remains a committed builder of world peace. Since the founding of New China, the country has pursued an independent foreign policy of peace and adhered to the path of peaceful development. It never started a war, never occupied one inch of foreign land, never engaged in proxy wars, and never participated in or organized any military bloc. Among the major countries, China has the best peace and security record. At present, China remains the only country in the world that undertakes to follow a path of peaceful development in its constitution, and the only one among the five nuclear-weapon states that has pledged no-first-use of nuclear weapons. No matter how developed China becomes, it will never seek hegemony, expansion or sphere of influence, nor will it engage in arms race. China will always be a strong pillar for peace and tranquility of humanity.China is committed to its international responsibilities and remains a firm defender of the international order. China is the first founding member of the United Nations to sign on the UN Charter. It firmly upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and advocates respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. China has dispatched the most peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is the second largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget. China has taken an active part in international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation processes. It has signed or acceded to more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). China opposes arms race, and upholds global strategic stability. China has pursued cooperation to address all forms of non-traditional security challenges, and provided more than 2.1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the international community in an active effort to bridge the “immunization gap”. China has announced its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and played its part in tackling climate change. It has launched the Global Initiative on Data Security as its proposed solution to global digital governance.China stays committed to dialogue and consultation, and remains a steadfast mediator of hot-spot issues. China firmly stands on the side of peaceful dialogue, equity and justice, and actively explores solutions with Chinese characteristics to hot-spot issues. On Ukraine, China takes an objective and fair stance on the basis of the merits and demerits of the issue, and vigorously advise peace and encourage talks. This has been highly recognized by the international community, particularly the vast number of developing countries. On the Middle East, China has put forward a four-point proposal on resolving the Palestinian question and a five-point initiative on promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. It supports the countries and peoples in the Middle East in addressing regional security issues through solidarity and coordination, and supports their independent exploration for development paths of their own. On the Iranian nuclear issue, China actively promotes the negotiations to resume compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and upholds the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. On the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, China remains committed to making synchronized progress in the establishment of a permanent peace mechanism and the denuclearization of the Peninsula. And it believes that the legitimate concerns of all parties should be addressed in a balanced manner. On Afghanistan, China has taken the initiative to carry out international coordination and provide humanitarian assistance, playing a constructive role for the smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan.IV. Implementing fully the major propositions and policy goals of the GSIVisions set the course, and actions shape the future. More than proposing the GSI, China acts on this major Initiative. We stand ready to work with the international community to ensure that the GSI, put forward by President Xi Jinping, will take root and come into fruition, so that the world will enjoy greater peace, security and prosperity.We need to firmly uphold the authority and stature of the UN and jointly practice true multilateralism. Multilateral institutions provide the main platforms for practicing multilateralism and the basic framework for defending it. We need to unswervingly uphold the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom. We must reject attempts to stoke confrontation and division along ideological lines, forge “small circles”, undermine the international order in the name of preserving so-called “rules”, and put the world under the shadow of a “new Cold War”.We need to stick to the overall direction of promoting talks for peace and jointly explore political solutions to hot-spot issues. It is important to strengthen strategic communication among countries to enhance mutual security confidence, diffuse tensions, manage differences and eliminate root causes of crises. We need to actively explore possibilities for cooperation between states, expand the convergence of security interests, and nurture international and regional security dynamics that balance the aspirations and accommodate the interests of all parties. Major countries shoulder a special and important responsibility in resolving international and regional hot-spot issues. They must uphold justice, encourage dialogue, facilitate talks for peace, play good offices and mediate in light of the needs and will of the countries concerned, and act as anchors of peace instead of fire bellows in the likelihood of conflicts.We need to take a holistic approach to traditional and non-traditional security threats, and jointly improve the global security governance system. Facing various types of security threats, countries must unite and cooperate rather than act on one’s own. We need to further strengthen international solidarity against COVID-19, improve global governance in public health, and ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries, so as to foster a strong synergy of COVID response. We need to work together to counter terrorism, the common enemy of humanity, build a global nuclear security architecture featuring fairness and win-win cooperation, improve rules of governance on new frontiers such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space and the Internet, and follow the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits in global governance, so as to prevent and resolve security dilemmas.We need to strike a balance between development and security, and jointly contribute to a robust recovery of the world economy. More emphasis should be put on development to actively improve people’s living standards, narrow the wealth gap, bridge the development divide, and promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development. We need to stay committed to building an open world economy, strengthen policy coordination, keep global industrial and supply chains stable and smooth, resolutely oppose decoupling and supply disruption, and make globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. We need to actively implement the GDI, place development high on the global macro policy agenda, better synergize development strategies, and accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to enhance sustainable security through sustainable development.We need to seek to build a new regional security architecture and jointly protect peace and stability in Asia. Asia is an anchor for world peace, a powerhouse for global growth and a new pacesetter for international cooperation, and it needs a new security architecture compatible with its economic foundation. We should build a model of security for Asia featuring mutual respect, openness and integration that takes into account the diversity of Asian countries in terms of development stages, social systems and cultural values and accommodate the aspirations and interests of all parties. We must firmly oppose any attempt to divide the region and wage a “new Cold War” through the so-called Indo-Pacific strategy, and reject the attempt to piece together an Asia-Pacific version of NATO through military alliances. We must firmly uphold ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, deepen regional and sub-regional security cooperation, and find a path for Asia that ensures security for all, by all, and of all.By following the trend of history and taking the right path, one can reach high and go far. China stands ready to work with all peace-loving countries and peoples committed to development to carry out the GSI put forward by President Xi Jinping, open up a broad path toward lasting peace and universal security, and forge a strong synergy to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Let the torch of peace be passed on from generation to generation and the sound of peace echo throughout the world.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022Beijing, 21 April 2022Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,Your Excellencies Heads of International Organizations,Your Excellencies Members of the Board of Directors of the Boao Forum for Asia,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,It gives me great pleasure to once again join friends old and new online for the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022. I want to begin by extending, on behalf of the Chinese government and people and also in my own name, hearty welcome to all participating guests and warm congratulations on the convening of the Annual Conference.Right now, changes of the world, of our times and of history are unfolding in ways like never before. These changes are posing challenges that must be taken seriously by humanity. We have yet to walk from the shadow of a once-in-a-century pandemic, but new traditional security risks are already emerging. The weak and faltering global economic recovery is compounded by a widening development gap. While governance deficit in areas like climate change has hardly been addressed, new issues such as digital governance are also vying for attention. Viewed in such a context, the theme of this year’s Annual Conference “The World in COVID-19 & Beyond: Working Together for Global Development and Shared Future” cannot be more relevant.As an ancient Chinese adage goes, “One must not change his commitment or give up his pursuit even in the face of danger and risk.” A review of human history teaches us that the more difficult things get, the greater the need grows to stay confident. Problems are not to be afraid of, as it is one problem after another that have driven the progress of human society. No difficulties could ever stop the wheel of history. Faced with the many challenges, we must not lose confidence, hesitate or flinch. Instead, we must firm up confidence and press ahead against all odds.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,For us to break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity. Over the past two years and more, the international community has been working extremely hard to respond to the COVID-19 challenge and boost global recovery and development. The hardships and challenges are yet another reminder that humanity is a community with a shared future where all people rise and fall together, and that all countries need to follow the trend of the times featuring peace, development and win-win cooperation, move in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and rise to challenges and build a bright future through cooperation.— We need to work together to defend people's lives and health. Safety and health are the prerequisite for human development and progress. For humanity to clinch a final victory against the COVID-19 pandemic, more hard efforts are needed. It is essential that countries support each other, better coordinate response measures and improve global public health governance, so as to form strong international synergy against the pandemic. We must keep COVID vaccines a global public good and ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries. China has provided over 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Be it in delivering vaccines abroad or producing them overseas, China has honored its commitments with concrete actions. China will follow through the pledged donation of 600 million and 150 million doses of vaccines to Africa and ASEAN countries respectively, as part of our effort to close the immunization gap.— We need to work together to promote economic recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously eroded the gains the world has made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Uneven recovery is aggravating inequality across the world, further widening the North-South divide. We should stay committed to building an open world economy, stay on top of the dominant trend of economic globalization, increase macro policy coordination, turn to science and technology for more growth drivers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and prevent serious negative spillovers from policy adjustments in some countries, all in an effort to promote balanced, coordinated and inclusive global development. We should follow a people-centered approach, place development and people’s well-being high on the agenda and, when policies are implemented, measures adopted and actions taken, always give top priority to bettering people's lives. We should pay due attention to the pressing needs of developing countries and advance practical cooperation in such key areas as poverty reduction, food security, development financing and industrialization, in a bid to address uneven and inadequate development. The Global Development Initiative (GDI) I proposed last year has been echoed and supported by the United Nations and other international organizations and nearly 100 countries. China is working with the international community on the solid implementation of the GDI.— We need to work together to maintain peace and stability in the world. An ancient Chinese philosopher observed, “Stability brings a country prosperity while instability leads a country to poverty.” Security is the precondition for development. We humanity are living in an indivisible security community. It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century. To promote security for all in the world, China would like to propose a Global Security Initiative as follows: It is important that we stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security; stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one's own security at the cost of others’ security; stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity. — We need to work together to tackle global governance challenges. Countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share the same destiny. For the ship to navigate the storm and sail toward a bright future, all passengers must pull together. The thought of throwing anyone overboard is simply not acceptable. In this day and age, the international community has evolved so much that it has become a sophisticated and integrated apparatus. Acts to remove any single part will cause serious problems to its operation. When that happens, both the victims and the initiators of such acts will stand to lose. In today's world, unilateralism and excessive pursuit of self-interest are doomed to fail; so are the practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure; so are the attempts to forge “small circles” or to stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines. Instead, we need to embrace a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, promote the common values of humanity, and advocate exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations. We need to uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law. It is particularly important for major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, cooperation, good faith and the rule of law, and act in a way befitting their status. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,Having been through hot and cold wars, hardships and tribulations, people in Asia deeply cherish the value of peace and understand that development gains do not come easily. Over the past decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability and sustained rapid growth, making possible the Asian Miracle. When Asia fares well, the whole world benefits. Therefore, we need to continue developing and strengthening Asia, demonstrate Asia's resilience, wisdom and strength, and make Asia an anchor for world peace, a powerhouse for global growth and a new pacesetter for international cooperation. First, we should resolutely safeguard peace in Asia. Peace and stability in our region does not fall into our lap automatically or come as charity from any country. Rather, it is the result of the joint efforts of countries in the region. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, first advocated by Asia, are all the more relevant today. We should honor such principles as mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, follow a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship, and make sure that we always keep our future in our own hands.Second, we should vigorously advance Asian cooperation. Many Asian proverbs describe the value of solidarity and cooperation, such as “climb the hill together and go down the ravine together” and “sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps”. Win-win cooperation is a sure path to Asian development. The entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the opening to traffic of the China-Laos railway have effectively boosted institutional and physical connectivity in our region. We should seize these opportunities to foster a more open Asia-wide market and make new strides in  mutually beneficial cooperation.Third, we should jointly promote Asian unity. Choosing dialogue and cooperation over zero-sum games, openness and inclusiveness over a closed-door and exclusive approach, and exchanges and mutual learning over a sense of superiority: this is the only choice worthy of the broad-mindedness of Asians. We should cement ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and uphold a regional order that balances the aspirations and accommodates the interests of all parties. Countries, no matter their size and strength, and both in and outside the region, should all add splendor rather than trouble to Asia. All should follow the path of peace and development, seek win-win cooperation, and contribute to an Asian family of unity and progress together.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Two months ago, China presented to the world a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, bringing warmth and hope to people across the globe. In the second half of this year, we will convene the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which will draw the blueprint for China's future development.The fundamentals of the Chinese economy — its strong resilience, enormous potential, vast room for maneuver and long-term sustainability — remain unchanged. They will provide great dynamism for the stability and recovery of the world economy and broader market opportunities for all countries. China will fully apply its new development philosophy, accelerate the establishment of a new development paradigm, and redouble efforts for high-quality development. No matter how the world will change, China's faith in and its commitment to reform and opening-up will not waver. China will expand high-standard opening-up, fully implement the negative list for foreign investment, expand the encouraged catalogue for FDI, improve services for investment promotion, and add more cities to the comprehensive pilot program for service sector opening. China will take solid steps to develop its pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port, align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and move ahead with institutional opening-up. China will implement the RCEP in full, seek the conclusion of high-standard FTAs with more countries and regions, and actively work for joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). China will press ahead with high-quality Belt and Road cooperation to make it high-standard, sustainable and people-centered. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, and always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Let me conclude with an old Chinese saying, “Keep walking and one will not be daunted by a thousand miles; make constant efforts and one will not be intimidated by a thousand tasks.” As long as we join hands and never slacken in efforts, we will build great synergy through win-win cooperation, overcome the various challenges along the way, and usher in a brighter and better future for humanity.Thank you.
                

                Islamabad, 22 March 2022It is a great pleasure to be invited to attend and speak at the opening ceremony of the Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). This is the first time for China’s foreign minister to participate in the OIC-CFM meeting. It fully demonstrates the sincere desire of China and the Islamic world to strengthen exchange and cooperation, and will surely lift our relations to a new level.Both Chinese and Islamic civilizations are ancient civilizations with significant global influence. The exchanges between us date back centuries. Our exchanges have withstood the test of international vicissitudes, and enjoy a deep historical foundation and solid support from our peoples. Friendship has been the mainstream of our relations, equality the basis of our interaction, and mutual benefit the goal of our cooperation.Over the years, we have always respected and trusted each other, and supported each other on issues involving our respective core concerns. China will never forget that when Algeria and other countries jointly tabled a resolution at the United Nations, nearly 30 Islamic countries firmly supported it, carrying China into the Organization. Likewise, on the Palestinian issue which is of top concern to the Islamic world, China’s support has never been hesitant or absent.We have always stood in solidarity and mutual support, and shared a commitment to common development. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Islamic countries have immediately rendered China valuable support, and China has promptly provided 1.3 billion doses of vaccines and a large quantity of supplies to 50 Islamic countries. Belt and Road cooperation has become a bridge and bond connecting our two sides for development and prosperity. To date, China has signed BRI cooperation documents with 54 Islamic countries and launched nearly 600 large-scale projects worth of US$400 billion. The cooperation has delivered real benefits to the people of China and Islamic countries.We have always learned from each other and shared the commitment to safeguarding the diversity of civilizations of the world. Both Chinese and Islamic civilizations have made remarkable contributions to human civilization in history. Both have been treated unjustly in modern times. And today both are moving forward hand in hand on the journey toward development and rejuvenation. We should vigorously advocate equal-footed dialogue, exchange and mutual learning among civilizations, so as to draw wisdom from each other’s time-honored civilization, resist “civilization profiling”, and reject the notion of clash of civilizations.China and the Islamic world have found a path of friendship and win-win cooperation among civilizations. This is a fine example of how to practice the new type of international relations. And it also provides useful experience on how different countries and civilizations can interact with each other.In this volatile and changing world, the theme of this Session — “Building Partnerships for Unity, Justice and Development” — answers the common call of the majority of countries in the world. China will work with Islamic countries to uphold true multilateralism, defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and safeguard the UN-centered international system. In the pursuit of national rejuvenation, China and Islamic countries will always stand with each other to overcome challenges and forge ahead together. China is ready to work with Islamic countries to build the following four partnerships.We need to be partners upholding unity and coordination. Our two sides need to firmly support each other in defending national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, firmly support each other in independently exploring the development path befitting our respective national conditions, and firmly support each other in safeguarding legitimate development rights and interests and the common interests of the developing countries at large.We need to be partners advancing development and rejuvenation. We should stay united to defeat COVID-19. China will continue to provide 300 million doses of vaccine to Islamic countries to help them build a line of defence for health. We will foster greater synergy among our development strategies. We will pursue high quality Belt and Road cooperation and the Global Development Initiative (GDI) as “twin engines” to enhance cooperation in traditional areas and foster new highlights, so as to facilitate the development and rejuvenation of China and Islamic countries, guide South-South cooperation, and give a strong impetus to realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.We need to be partners promoting security and stability. China will continue to support the efforts by Islamic countries to use Islamic wisdom to solve current hotspot issues and to hold the key to peace and stability firmly in their own hands.China will continue to stand firmly with the Palestinian people. China supports an early, more authoritative and representative international peace conference on the basis of the two-state solution so as to promote a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian issue.China respects the choice of the Afghan people, and supports Afghanistan’s efforts to usher in an inclusive political structure and moderate governance and open a new chapter of peace and reconstruction.On Kashmir, we have heard again today the calls of many of our Islamic friends. And China shares the same hope.China supports Russia and Ukraine in continuing their peace talks, and hopes that the talks will lead to ceasefire, end the fighting, and bring about peace. Humanitarian disasters should be avoided, and spillover of the Ukrainian crisis should be prevented so as not to affect and harm the legitimate rights and interests of other regions and countries.We need to be partners enhancing mutual learning among civilizations. The two sides need to advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and reject the practice of stoking division and confrontation by drawing ideological lines. We need to advocate mutual learning among civilizations, reject notions such as superiority of certain civilizations and clash of civilizations, and oppose attempts to distort or vilify non-Western civilizations. We need to deepen cooperation on preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts, resist double standards on fighting terrorism, and oppose associating terrorism with any particular ethnic group or religion.History has proven, and will continue to prove, that China is a sincere friend and cooperation partner of the Islamic world. We stand ready to work with Islamic countries to promote multipolarity in the world, democracy in international relations and diversity of human civilizations, and make unremitting efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
                

                Address by Vice Foreign Minister Le YuchengAt the Fourth International Forum on Security and Strategy Friends,Good morning. It is a great pleasure to see friends old and new. Meeting virtually will not impede our communication and exchange. At such a special moment in particular, there is a greater need to bring together different perspectives on the international developments and discuss the underlying trend in the Asia-Pacific region.Speaking of international developments, the crisis in Ukraine is undoubtedly the biggest eye of the storm at the moment. Though the forum today is about the Asia-Pacific, we still have to start with Ukraine. On Ukraine, I am no stranger to the country. Being a student of the Russian language and Russian literature in university, I got to know about the Slavs first from Kievan Rus. In the diplomatic career, I visited Ukraine many times, and once drove across the country, west to east, on a road trip. It is deeply distressing and lamentable that a country I am very familiar with is now embroiled in conflict. This is not what we wish to see under any circumstances.Since the crisis in Ukraine started, China has worked actively to promote dialogue for peace, voicing its support for peace and doing its best for talks. In the early days of the war, China proposed to Russia to hold peace talks with Ukraine, and received a positive response from the Russian side. Russia and Ukraine have since held four rounds of talks. At the recent virtual summit with leaders of France and Germany, President Xi Jinping emphasized support for peace negotiations. Last night, President Xi Jinping had a video call with US President Joe Biden upon request. The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-US relations and the situation in Ukraine. The call lasted for two hours. President Xi Jinping reiterated China’s basic position on the Ukraine issue. He pointed out that China stands for peace and opposes war, advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. President Xi Jinping quoted two Chinese sayings: “It takes two hands to clap” and “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.” He urged the parties involved to demonstrate political will and keep the dialogue and negotiation going. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine. President Xi Jinping stressed that an enduring solution to security would be for major countries to respect each other, reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and build step by step a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region and for the world. President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating.Friends,The European continent is a key region for world peace. It was marred by two World Wars and was not tranquil after the Cold War. Now flames of war are reignited. This is indeed deeply distressing and more importantly, should prompt us to profoundly reflect. I recall clearly that several Western strategists including George Kennan, Henry Kissinger and John Mearsheimer all sounded an alarm years ago, yet the situation still comes to what we see today. The lesson is hard and painful. And the root cause lies in the Cold War mentality and power politics. First, one should not seek its own absolute security. Since NATO promised that it would move “not one inch eastward”, it should not renege on its word and keep pushing its boundary eastward by up to one thousand kilometers. Should this enlargement go further, it would be approaching the “outskirts of Moscow” where a missile could hit the Kremlin within seven or eight minutes. The Cuban Missile Crisis has offered a lesson. Such pursuit of absolute security actually leads to absolute insecurity. Pushing a major country, especially a nuclear power, to the corner would entail repercussions too dreadful to contemplate.  Second, bloc politics and group confrontation should be rejected. Military bloc is a Cold War vestige. NATO and the Warsaw Pact were at loggerheads for nearly half a century. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, NATO should have been consigned to history alongside the Warsaw Pact. However, rather than breaking up, NATO has kept strengthening and expanding, and intervened militarily in countries like Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. In recent years, it even went so far as to flex muscle in the Asia-Pacific. One could well anticipate the consequences going down this path. The crisis in Ukraine is a stern warning.   Third, globalization should not be “weaponized”. China has all along opposed unilateral sanctions that have neither basis in international law nor mandate of the Security Council. History has shown time and again that instead of solving problems, imposing sanctions is like “putting out fire with firewood” and will only make things worse. Sanctions against Russia are now going to such lengths that globalization is used as a weapon, even people from the sports, cultural, art and entertainment communities are not spared, cats and trees are sanctioned, and the overseas assets of Russian citizens are seized groundlessly. The West has long espoused the ideas of “science without borders”, “non-politicization of sports”, the sanctity and inviolability of private property, freedom of speech and the spirit of honoring contracts, etc. I’m afraid no one would believe in them any more. Do these sanctions intend to bring human society back to a primitive stage where communities are isolated and have nothing to do with each other? Sanctions would only bring harm to the people, disrupt the post-war economic and financial systems, and weigh on the struggling world economy. At least from what we see lately, the risks of a food crisis, energy crisis and financial crisis are all mounting. Oil price surged to over 130 US dollars per barrel, and the price of natural gas in Europe saw a ten-fold spike over the same period last year. The abuse of sanctions will bring catastrophic consequences for the entire world.Fourth, small countries should not be used as a pawn. As we see in the world today, some big countries do not want to get dragged into conflicts and bring harm to themselves, so they make empty promises to small countries, turn small countries into their cat’s paw and even use them to fight proxy wars. A NATO commitment of no eastward expansion could have easily ended the crisis and stopped the sufferings. Instead, one chose to fan the flames at a safe distance, watching its own arms dealers, bankers and oil tycoons make a fortune out of the war while leaving people of a small country with the wounds of war that would take years to heal. This is highly immoral and irresponsible.Friends, The Ukraine crisis keeps the world on edge. It also provides a mirror for us to observe the situation in the Asia-Pacific. We cannot but ask, how can we prevent a crisis like this from happening in the Asia-Pacific? The Asia-Pacific is home to half the world’s population, and accounts for 60% of global GDP. It is an anchor for world peace and stability, an engine for global growth and a new pace-setter in international cooperation. Such a promising situation has not come easily and should be cherished by all sides. On the other hand, the Asia-Pacific now faces two opposite choices: should we build an open and inclusive family for win-win cooperation or go for small blocs based on the Cold War mentality and group confrontation? My answer can be summed up as four “dos” and four “don’ts”:First, we must cherish peace and not undermine regional tranquility. The Asia-Pacific has enjoyed overall peace for several decades. This is not a gift from heaven but the result of the joint and dedicated efforts of all countries in the region. It was in Asia that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and the ten principles of the Bandung Conference were first proposed. Asia is also the birthplace of the Shanghai Communiqué between China and the United States. Eight years ago, President Xi Jinping put forth the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. This vision, which was oriented toward Asia in the first place, is particularly relevant in the current context. No country should pursue its so-called absolute security at the expense of other countries’ security. Otherwise, as the proverb goes, “One who tries to blow out other’s oil lamp will get his beard on fire.”Second, we must respect each other and not wantonly interfere in others’ internal affairs. Despite the diverse civilizations and national conditions, Asian countries have sustained prosperity and stability for half a century. The key lies in the Asian way of mutual respect and consensus building. Countries should respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and refuse to do unto others what they would not want for themselves. Every country has the right to pursue a development path chosen by itself. Imposition or interference in others’ internal affairs should be rejected, and there is no need for “saviors” or “lecturers” .Third, we must promote unity and cooperation and not create division and confrontation. The Asia-Pacific has maintained vibrancy in a fluid and changing world. This is the result of united efforts by all regional countries. If we are pit against each other and engage in incessant infighting, we would put regional prosperity and stability in serious jeopardy. Now some country insists on going against the trend to pursue the Indo-Pacific strategy, provoke trouble, put together closed and exclusive small circles or groups, and get the region off course toward fragmentation and bloc-based division. Such an Indo-Pacific Strategy is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe. If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss. Fourth, we must pursue independence and self-strength and not let others decide our future. Pursuing divide-and-rule by stoking tensions to achieve offshore balancing is the modus operandi of hegemony. We in Asia must all stay alert about this and keep the future firmly in our own hands, instead of simply succumbing to others’ interests or becoming an easy pawn of others. We need to take the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as the fundamental guidance, and keep an objective and just position on international affairs. We need to make independent assessments and decisions in our own best interests, pursue independent, balanced and prudent foreign policies, and seek strength through unity in the process of regional integration.China stands ready to work with all countries in the Asia-Pacific under the banner of true multilateralism, to promote enduring peace, common development and open regionalism, and jointly open up brighter prospects for the Asia-Pacific community with a shared future.Thank you.
                

                The Fifth Session of the 13th National People’s Congress held a press conference at the Great Hall of the People on the morning of March 11, 2022. Premier Li Keqiang met with Chinese and foreign reporters and answered their questions at the invitation of Spokesperson Mr. Zhang Yesui. In his opening remarks, Premier Li Keqiang said that he was delighted to meet friends from the media and thanked the journalists for their hard work in covering China’s NPC and CPPCC Sessions. He noted that due to COVID-19 the press conference was again held via video link this year and then opened the floor for questions.Associated Press: I want to get your thoughts on the economic challenges China faces as it transitions from a high-growth era to a more sustainable, equitable and green growth. In the past year, the government has taken steps to reduce debt in the real estate market and regulate the digital economy. At the same time, the government has set a 5.5 percent growth target that many economists see as ambitious given the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Does this signal that China may make short-term adjustments this year that favor economic growth over a structural change and reducing carbon emissions? How does China balance the two? And specifically on Ukraine, how do China’s important trading relationships with Europe and the US factor into the government’s response to the crisis? Are you concerned that China’s support for Russia could harm those relationships and then in turn the Chinese economy itself?Premier Li: You asked about China’s economic growth. Last year, China’s economic aggregate reached over 110 trillion RMB yuan. Continued growth would be growth on a high base. Experience in the global sphere shows that it will be no easy for such a big economy to keep a medium-high growth rate. You said that a 5.5 percent GDP growth target for this year is viewed an ambitious one. I recall that at last year’s press conference, a journalist asked me whether a 6 percent GDP growth target was a bit too modest. My response was that we were aware of the possibility for even faster growth of the economy because of a low base of the previous year. But still we decided to set the growth target at above 6 percent, meaning that we left possibilities open for even faster growth, say, 8 percent, and we would welcome that. Nevertheless, we set macro economic policies, including fiscal, monetary and employment policies, against this 6 percent GDP growth target. We cut the deficit-to-GDP ratio and steadily lowered the macro leverage ratio. And we reserved policy space for coping with new challenges this year. We followed the same approach in 2020. In spite of the severe situation, we refused to flood the economy with mass stimulus or excessive money supply. As a result, despite the high inflation worldwide, China’s CPI rose less than 1 percent from last year to February this year. I think that very much has to do with our reasonable macro economic policies. Our macro economic policies are informed by China’s national conditions, and I have no intention to comment on the policies of other countries here. Last year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and thanks to the joint efforts of people across the country, we successfully achieved the major goals and tasks for economic and social development for the year, and laid a good foundation for development this year. This year, we face new downside pressures and challenges, with much complexity and rising uncertainty. With China’s GDP exceeding 100 trillion yuan, a 5.5 percent increase would generate the amount of output equivalent to the size of a medium economy. Ten years ago, when China’s GDP was just over 50 trillion yuan, even a 10 percent growth would only add some 6 to 7 trillion yuan of output. But this year, even with a lower growth rate, the figure would reach 9 trillion yuan in nominal GDP. To use the analogy of mountain climbing, in climbing a 1,000-meter-high mountain, covering 10 percent of the height is a distance of 100 meters. But in climbing a 3,000-meter-high mountain, 5 percent of the height will already be 150 meters. Moreover, the higher one climbs, the lower the air pressure, and the less the oxygen. So the growth may look slower now, but it actually carries more weight.We aim to achieve about 5.5 percent growth this year to ensure the steady performance of the Chinese economy at a high level, which is in itself a show of progress. To achieve this goal is not easy, and needs the support of a series of macro policies. Take fiscal policy for example, we have lowered our deficit-to-GDP ratio to 2.8 percent this year, a decrease of more than 200 billion yuan over last year. But we will beef up government spending this year. One may naturally ask, how to pay for that? I have set it out in the Government Work Report. We will draw on the savings that we didn’t tap into over the last two years, meaning we will use the surplus profits of state-owned financial institutions and state monopoly business operations and funds transferred from the Central Budget Stabilization Fund. In total, government spending this year will rise by no less than 2 trillion yuan. Most of it will be used for tax and fee reductions, particularly tax refund, just like providing oxygen supply for mountain climbers. At the same time, we will roll out a series of supportive financial and pro-job measures too. Our policies set for this year are not just aimed at addressing immediate needs. They also take into account long-term development needs. They will not sacrifice future interests and are therefore sustainable. Like you said, China is still faced with a series of challenges, such as climate change, income gap, and debt. We need to forcefully respond to them this year and in a medium-to-long run. The measures required are being worked on. China’s modernization is a long process. We need to address issues arising in the course of development through development.On Ukraine, the current situation there is a focus of international attention. China is deeply concerned and grieved. We sincerely hope that the situation will ease and peace will return at an early date. China has all along followed an independent foreign policy of peace, and never targets third parties in our bilateral ties. We want to develop cooperation with all countries on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit, to bring greater stability to today’s world. Reuters: Since Russia’s attack on Ukraine, there have been two million refugees, hundreds of civilian deaths, and growing worries about the prospect of nuclear escalation. Yet China has refused to condemn Russia’s conduct or call it an “invasion”. Will China refrain from condemning Russia’s conduct in Ukraine no matter what it does? Is China prepared to provide further economic and financial support for Russia as it faces sanctions? And is China concerned about sanctions blowback from other countries if it does so?Premier Li: As I have just said, China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. Regarding the situation in Ukraine, China believes that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, and the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. On that basis, China makes its own assessment, and is prepared to work with the international community to play a positive role for an early return to peace. The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting. Utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome. We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control. There is consensus about this among the international community, including the parties concerned. China calls for exercising utmost restraint and preventing a massive humanitarian crisis. China has put forward an initiative for responding to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. China has provided Ukraine with humanitarian assistance, and will continue to do so.Reeling from COVID-induced shocks, the world economy is already struggling. Relevant sanctions will hurt the world economic recovery and are in no one’s interest. China is ready to make its own constructive efforts in maintaining peace and stability and promoting development and prosperity in the world. CNBC: The National Institute for Finance and Development says that fee cuts help small businesses more, and then second is the tax cuts. But are there exact figures for how the tax and fee cuts exactly helped the economy? And what are the considerations for local governments, especially as they are faced with the property market’s slowdown and their effect to revenues? And finally, for the consumer aspect, are there considerations for using consumer vouchers or other measures? Premier Li: Conclusions should be supported with theories and practices. Our practices in recent years show that tax and fee cuts have worked most directly. I recall that last year I had a conversation with a dozen business representatives in an eastern province. They talked about their corporate difficulties and their hope for more macro policy support from the government. I said that the central government had policies in reserve, yet we need to use them in an integrated way. I gave them three options to pick one they preferred the most. They are, massive investment, which will help them get orders; the second is handing out consumption vouchers to boost consumer spending; and the third is tax and fee reductions for enterprises to stabilize employment and boost investment and consumption. They were only quiet for a moment and almost unanimously chose the third policy option, because they believed it would work most directly in a most equitable and efficient way. Many reports I have received this year also take tax and fee cuts as the number one aspiration for the government’s macro policies. Indeed, fertilizer needs to go to the root. When the root is strong, the plant can grow well.Some worry that tax and fee reductions have been in place for several years, and the marginal effect of this policy will fade. In other words, the policy will not work as well as before. This year, we will combine tax and fee reductions with massive tax refunds, with a total amount of 2.5 trillion yuan. It was also with such policy intensity that we pulled through those very difficult times in 2020. We have made some adjustments this time, and tax refund will be the highlight of policy for 2022. Under the current VAT tax code, there will be tax collection first, and tax refund later for enterprises. This year, we will refund in advance the existing overpaid VAT credits in a lump sum worth 1.5 trillion yuan. If this works well, we are prepared to step it up.Priority will be given to micro and small firms in the refunding of VAT credits, because these firms cover a wide range of sectors, large in number and provide many jobs. Currently, many of them are financially strapped and are in great difficulty. We will refund all the outstanding VAT credits to micro and small firms in a lump sum by the end of June. Refunding of VAT credits to manufacturing, R&D service providers and other key industries will be fully settled within this year. Newly increased VAT credits of micro and small firms will be refunded on a monthly basis. I recall that in my discussions with CPPCC members, a member who is also a businessman told me that compared with other tax and fee cuts and investment policies, tax refunds work the fastest and the best, whereas investment projects involve a lot of procedures. VAT refunds, however, are like direct funding support for the liquidity of businesses. They are what firms need most. Getting one concrete thing done is more important than making 1000 promises. We must see to it that this policy highlight will be fully delivered.Tax refunds and fee cuts are making subtraction, but could also be addition in essence. Refunds today could lead to increase in tax revenue in the future. For example, last year, newly registered market entities paid more taxes than the amount of tax reductions for the year. There are clear records for this. Since 2013, with the launch of VAT reform, we have cut taxes by the amount of 8.7 trillion yuan. Back then our fiscal revenue was about 11 trillion yuan. Last year, fiscal revenue exceeded 20 trillion yuan, nearly double the amount in 2013. In this process, businesses have truly benefited and improved their performance. It’s like building a deeper pool to farm more fish. The tax refunds and fee cuts have helped create more sources of tax revenue and nurture business growth.You mentioned new difficulties local governments face in their fiscal revenues. The central government is aware of that. This year the central government’s transfer payments to local governments will rise by 18% and reach 9.8 trillion yuan, an amount rarely seen over the years. Most tax refunds will be financed by the central government, and a certain amount will also be shared by local governments. I want to emphasize that tax refunds will go straight to businesses and given the difficulty of primary-level governments, transfer payment subsidies will be channeled to prefecture- and county-level governments and below. All local governments must count every cent and make every cent count to ensure that all funding support for businesses will be fully delivered, and it would be even better if more could be done.Phoenix TV: Over the past year, elections of the Election Committee and the seventh Legislative Council were held in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This year, election of the sixth-term Chief Executive will be held there. Close attention is being paid to how this election will be conducted under the new electoral system and at a time when the COVID situation in Hong Kong has yet to turn the corner? What is your comment, Mr. Premier?Premier Li: The current COVID situation in Hong Kong is indeed serious. The Hong Kong SAR government has decided in accordance with the law to postpone election of the sixth-term Chief Executive to concentrate on dealing with the COVID situation. We have full understanding and support for that. The Central Government follows the COVID situation in Hong Kong every day and has deep concern for the life, health and safety of residents in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR government needs to fulfil its primary responsibility in tackling the situation and the Central Government will give full support. We are steadfast in our commitment to fully and faithfully implement the principle of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. The change of government in the Hong Kong SAR will happen in strict accordance with relevant provisions in the Basic Law. We hope the SAR government will unite and lead people across sectors in Hong Kong to continue to grow the economy, improve people’s lives, consolidate and elevate Hong Kong’s status as an international financial, trading and shipping center, and maintain Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability. CCTV: We are seeing unstable business expectations, job cuts in certain industries and layoffs by some companies. Meanwhile, more job seekers are joining the labor force. Mr. Premier, what measures will the government take this year to achieve the goal of stable employment? Premier Li: Employment bears on people’s lives and the country’s development. A job helps to generate income, make life promising and create wealth. I recall that in my visit to enterprises last year, the head of a company told me that many of their employees would ask for an advance on wages in August every year, because they need the money to pay their children’s tuition fees in September.Before this year’s Spring Festival, I visited rural areas in China’s northwest. A local farmer told me that he had one child in college with a cost of 10,000-plus yuan each year, and one other child in senior high school with a cost of more than 8,000 yuan a year. He said that he had to go to work in the city, or he wouldn’t be able to make enough money to cover these expenses by just growing grain on his small land plot. I have always been deeply touched by the hard work of our people. Staying in work is not just about earning enough to support family, but also securing a better life for the younger generation.We will step up the implementation of our macro policies this year, and fiscal and monetary policies need to help us achieve the goal on employment. Hence, our employment-first policy is also a macro policy, whose implementation will be supported by other policies. Each year we need to create over 11 million, preferably 13 million new urban jobs. If we could achieve maximum employment, we would be able to achieve what some people say, China’s potential economic growth rate.There is one concrete example here. In the raging times of COVID-19 back in 2020, we decided not to set a GDP growth target, but we set the target of new urban jobs at above nine million. The outcome was that we created over 11 million new urban jobs. China’s economic growth stayed in the positive territory, and reached 2.2 percent. The Chinese economy was the only one among major economies to achieve a positive growth.This year we will see a record high increase of new job seekers into the labor force, totaling some 16 million. There will be 10.76 million students graduating from college, another record high. There needs to be work for some 300 million rural migrant workers. Jobs also need to be provided to ex-service members. And some people are waiting to get re-employed in case of business insolvency. There is a steady increase in the urban labor force, and new platforms of employment need to be created. The government will provide these new job seekers with training opportunities and other support. More importantly, we need to rely on market-oriented means to resolve employment issues. In recent years, we have pursued the initiative of mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and promoted the development of new technologies, new industries and new business models to foster new drivers of growth. We believe that there is great intelligence and potential in each individual. When their talent and potential is fully brought out, we can open great prospects for employment. I would be remiss if I did not mention flexible employment here. Over 200 million people are now engaged in flexible employment which takes multiple forms and covers a wide range of sectors. This kind of employment will long exist in a developing country like China. Many of the people in flexible employment are express delivery service providers. They have to work braving winds and rains. Many localities have provided them with heart-warming services. The government should improve policies related to their labor rights and interests as well as social protection, just like providing safety belt to deliverymen. In this way, these new forms of employment will not only meet people’s pressing need, but also help unlock market vitality and public creativity. EFE: We are already two years into the pandemic. And China has remained closed to the world during all this time. So my question is for how long is zero-COVID policy sustainable for China? Is there a road map to start reopening the country in the foreseeable future?Premier Li: The novel coronavirus is a common enemy of humankind. The virus has been with us for two years, yet is still changing. Much remains to be learned about it. Meanwhile, protection through vaccines and R&D of effective drugs need to be enhanced. The international community should embrace unity, cooperation and mutual assistance, show greater mutual understanding and accommodation, and make joint efforts to create conditions for our world’s early return to normal. China has adopted a coordinated approach to COVID response and economic and social development. We have been actively promoting international exchanges and cooperation. We will make our response more scientific and targeted in light of the evolving COVID situation and features of the virus, to protect people’s life and health, keep up the normal running of work and life, and ensure the security of industrial and supply chains.In my many conversations with heads of international institutions and multinationals as well as business leaders since the pandemic started, many expressed the hope for ensuring necessary business exchanges. China has opened the “fast lanes” and “green corridors” to ensure the normal running of companies and projects in key areas. We will continue to gain experience and be adaptable to new developments, to gradually restore unimpeded flow of goods and personnel in an orderly way. Xinhua News Agency: Recent years have seen steady improvement in China’s business climate, as evidenced by a surge in market entities and easier access to government services for enterprises. However, various disturbances to business activity still exist. What more will the government do to improve the business climate and better stimulate market vitality and public creativity?Premier Li: Every year in the past decade, the State Council would hold a national work conference on the reform of government functions and improvement of China’s business climate. I’ve also noted that improving business climate was high on the agenda of the first meetings of many local governments in the new year. Reforming government functions could be likened to improving soils for the growth of market entities. Our policy of tax and fee reductions is like applying fertilizer and water, and the initiative of mass entrepreneurship and innovation aims to help more market entities take root and grow. When public creativity is leveraged, and the vitality of market entities unleashed, one could well anticipate vibrant economic growth. This requires the government pursue self-targeted reform to see that government power does not revolve around departmental interests. Rather, we need to advance reform to help market entities to emerge and flourish. Shaking up vested interests could be more difficult than touching the depths of souls. Yet we must keep up the consistency of policy, which is critical for exercising governance. We have pressed ahead with market-oriented reforms and the reform of the government’s own functions over the years. Through these reforms, over 1,000 administrative approval items have been canceled or delegated to lower-level authorities. The non-administrative approval requirement was made a thing of the past. It used to take several dozen days, even up to over 100 days, to open a business. But now, it takes only four days, or just one day in some places. About 90 percent of government services can now be accessed inter-provincially, online or through cellphone apps, with no need of making physical visits. These measures have helped eliminate the thickets of vested interests and change the government’s traditional way of thinking. And we will work to bring more benefits to businesses and the people.With an improving business climate in recent years, the number of market entities in China has reached 150 million, a net increase of 100 million over ten years ago. Most of them are privately-held, among which self-employed households now amount to 100 million. No one should underestimate these self-employed households. They support the livelihoods of many families, and meet consumer demand. Entrepreneurs in the CPPCC told me had it not been for the role of those micro and small firms and self-employed households in keeping up unimpeded flows of the economy, bigger companies, even state-owned enterprises and centrally-managed enterprises, would be hamstrung.With bold reform measures, a sound business climate and a large number of market entities, a place often enjoys bright economic prospects. I have also repeatedly stressed that streamlining administration and enhancing oversight should go hand in hand. Streamlining administration does not mean a diminishing in government responsibilities, and the government has the duty to exercise regulation and supervision. Delegation of authority shouldn’t give rise to regulatory gaps either. We will resolutely combat the malpractices of counterfeiting and cheating on marketplace. We will enhance regulation in areas concerning people’s life and health and public interests, like food, drugs, workplace safety and the financial sector, and deal with any violation of laws and regulations. As new forms of industry and new business models keep developing, we will improve our regulatory approaches to ensure that market entities can truly compete and grow in a fair and just environment. Bloomberg News: Fifty years ago, then US President Richard Nixon visited China and began what became known as a period of American engagement with China. Last year, the Biden administration said that period had come to an end, and China and the US were headed instead into a period of intense competition. I wonder Mr. Premier, if you would agree with that assessment? Will things such as bans on American semiconductors being sold in China or bans against Chinese companies listing shares in the US become more and more common?Premier Li: Fifty years ago, China and the US broke the ice and started a journey of normalizing relations between the two countries. Half a century has passed. China-US relations have all along been moving forward despite ups and downs. We hope that the two countries will act in accordance with the common understandings reached between the two Presidents in their virtual meeting at the end of last year, respect each other, live together in peace and pursue win-win cooperation. We hope the two countries will properly manage differences in a rational and constructive manner, and respect each other’s core interests and major concerns. It is preferable to have more dialogue and communication. Now that the door has been opened, it shouldn’t be shut again, still less should there be decoupling.China and the US are both permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the world’s largest developing and developed countries respectively. Getting this relationship right serves the well-being of people of both countries. Many global challenges today require the joint efforts and cooperation of China and the US. It is fair to say that China-US cooperation is beneficial to both countries and the world.China and the US are vastly different in social system, history, culture and stage of development. Disagreements are hardly avoidable. However, we believe cooperation should be the mainstream, because global peace and development hinges on cooperation. Even if there is market competition between the two countries in economy and trade, it should be healthy and fair. Last year, China-US trade exceeded US$750 billion, up nearly 30 percent over the previous year. This shows China-US cooperation has extensive areas and much untapped potential. If the US chooses to ease its export restrictions on China, two-way trade volume will grow even bigger, delivering more benefits to both countries and their peoples. China is ready to work with the US to expand common ground and pursue interests for the long run.China News Service: We find that due to COVID-19 impacts in the past two years, many street-side eateries and small restaurants have no longer opened for business since closure. In addition to catering, industries like hospitality, retail and passenger transport have also been hard hit. It was proposed in the Government Work Report that efforts will be made to keep business operations stable and ensure job security. Mr. Premier, what measures will the government take this year to help these industries in distress? Premier Li: COVID-19 has hit the services sector the hardest, especially contact-based service industries. Many firms in these industries are micro, small and medium-sized enterprises who are already quite weak financially and running on a tight budget. The building up of difficulties is too much for them to bear. Supporting their operations is helping maintain job security, because the 100 million self-employed households are providers of close to 300 million jobs. We must provide them with timely help as they play an important leveraging role irrespective of size. Timely support is critical, because it will be too late to water a plant if the root is dried out. For these industries in special difficulty, we have worked out over 40 supportive measures. Tax refunds alone for catering, tourism, passenger transport and the cultural sector will amount to 180 billion yuan. In addition to fiscal support, we encourage banks to provide loan extension on a seamless basis for promising businesses. We also urge temporary cuts or exemptions of rentals and electricity bills where possible for these market entities, and capable local governments should also extend support. This is also a way of property owners keeping the clients. Consumer demand is indeed quite subdued now, especially consumption in bricks and mortar shops. We may well imagine a lively city life is very much about the hustle and bustle in marketplaces and shops. Business closure is no good news for anyone. It could even affect people’s daily lives. In this sense, policy support for the industries in distress is not just to tide these industries over difficulties; it also helps add warmth to people’s lives and bring greater vibrancy to the economy.ET Today of Taiwan: Under the situation of further spread of the coronavirus and rising uncertainty and instability in the cross-Strait relations, how will the mainland respond to the situation across the Taiwan Strait, and uphold and promote the well-being of people on both sides of the Strait? Premier Li: Our major principles and policies on work related to Taiwan are clear-cut. I have laid them out in the Government Work Report. That is, we are committed to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus. We firmly oppose separatist activities seeking “Taiwan independence” and we will advance the peaceful growth of cross-Strait relations and the reunification of China. At the end of the day, compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are members of one family. At no time can this fraternal bond be severed. We will continue to share with our Taiwan compatriots development opportunities, provide those on the mainland with equal treatment, and take concrete measures to benefit them and help them resolve difficulties. When people across the Strait come together and forge ahead in unity, we can surely promote the peaceful growth of cross-Strait relations, and share in the well-being of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Lianhe Zaobao: The year 2022 is the last year of the current term of the Chinese government. Looking back at the course of governance in the past four years, what do you think are the major achievements of this government? What is the biggest challenge for it? With China’s economy under unprecedented pressure, what will be the government’s policy priorities in the last year of its term, to keep up public confidence and respond to people’s concerns?Premier Li: Since the formation of this government, there have been much complexity and change in the international environment, as well as entwined difficulties and challenges at home. But the biggest challenge came from the COVID-19 pandemic, which dealt a heavy blow to China’s economy. In responding to the challenge, we have not settled for the easy option or shied away from what’s difficult and the risks, and have put in our greatest efforts.I recall that at my first press conference as Premier, held in this very same place, I laid out the basic tasks for the government as sustaining economic development, improving people’s lives and promoting social fairness. I also said we need to follow the Great Way, put people first and deliver benefits for all. In other words, the people’s wish always points the way for the government. This is what we have been doing consistently and diligently throughout the years. We have been innovative in exercising governance. We have dealt with cyclical fluctuations in economic activity by keeping major economic indicators within an appropriate range. In particular, we have implemented macro policies in a way that is directly responsive to the needs of market entities. We have pressed ahead with reforms to cut red tape and uphold justice. We have nurtured and supported the growth of market entities and new drivers of growth to boost market vitality and social creativity. We have implemented an employment-first policy and focused on ensuring people’s basic welfare in keeping with national realities. We are aware that while our people are happy with some aspects of the government’s work, there are also areas where we still fall short of their expectations.You said this year is the last year in the current term of the Chinese government. This year is also the last year of my premiership. We are still faced with a complicated and challenging environment and there are still many difficulties and challenges at play. As to how to respond to these challenges and difficulties, I have set out our policies in the Government Work Report and also in my answers to some previous questions. I and my colleagues will make persistent efforts, conscientiously perform our duties and take solid steps to live up to our promises.I am confident that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with the strong support of various sectors, and especially with the joint hard work of the Chinese people, China’s economy will be able to overcome difficulties. We will be able to achieve the major goals and tasks for economic and social development set for the whole year, and lay a due, solid foundation for the future development of the country.People’s Daily: China’s per capita income has been steadily rising in recent years. However, many people still find their lives quite hard. In particular, meeting of people’s basic living needs has been quite severely affected by COVID-19. Mr. Premier, what will the government do this year to further improve people’s lives?Premier Li: Indeed, in recent years, our people’s income has been growing in tandem with GDP. However, China remains a developing country. There is still a notable urban-rural gap. It will take a long time for us to achieve equal access to public services across the country. A report I received early this year listed the people’s top ten hopes for their life this year. Most of them concern basic living needs or come from farmers. Ensuring and promoting people’s lives should always be the fundamental purpose of the government’s effort in growing the economy. The government must continue to make utmost efforts and within its capacity to keep making improvements to people’s lives. China’s fiscal revenue has reached 20 trillion yuan, but the country still faces fiscal strains. Nevertheless, we have managed to keep fiscal spending on education above 4% of GDP for ten consecutive years. This is by no means easy. Most of the government spending has gone to compulsory education and supported rural areas, because we still have 760 million registered rural population in China. We will increase government funds to compulsory education in rural and remote areas.We have established in China the world’s largest medical insurance system covering some 1.4 billion people. However, the benefits are still quite modest at the moment. This year, the government will increase the government subsidy by 30 yuan per person. We have established a program of medical insurance for major illnesses, using basic medical insurance funds for the purchase of commercial insurance for major illnesses. In some places this program has enabled reimbursement of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan for some illnesses. And no particular numerical cap is put on the amount of reimbursement in certain regions. On average, some 70% of medical bills of rural and urban non-working residents can get reimbursed, and we will increase the benefits as our capacity grows. In particular, we need to consolidate the outcomes in ending absolute poverty and provide particular support to people who risk falling back to poverty due to illness or struggle with poverty caused by major illnesses. Meeting basic living needs concerns people’s daily lives. Nowadays some 100 million Chinese are in cross-provincial mobility. Some are elderly people living away from hometowns with their children in cities. Some are for employment or education. They face much hassle of travel in getting certain things done. Hence, accessing government services inter-provincially has become a new constant demand among the people. One new policy we will introduce this year is to make ID cards that are in most frequent use in people’s daily lives electronic, which helps one get certain things done by a simple code-scanning on cell phones. We will also provide convenience for people who do not use smart phones, especially the elderly. In the meantime, we will ensure information security and individuals’ privacy. To ensure the basic living needs of our people, we must take every bit of solid effort and put heart into it. We must be fully aware of the situation on the ground and always heed the people’s call. Livelihood issues are linked with the conditions people face, public opinion and even popular support. The government is duty-bound to follow the aspirations of the people, help them resolve difficulties and enable them to lead a better life. Here I want to emphasize that a people’s government must live up to its responsibility of protecting the people’s lawful rights and interests. The recent incident involving gross violations of women’s rights and interests is deeply distressing and we feel indignant about it. Those who showed disregard for people’s rights and interests must be held to account. Perpetrators of the trafficking of women and children must be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of law. Ensuring people’s safety and bettering their lives cannot be separated. Governments at all levels must take it as their basic responsibility and do their best to improve people’s lives and protect their safety. Kyodo News: China is working toward the goal of common prosperity and said it will adopt a traffic-light regulatory approach to prevent unregulated expansion of capital. Regulation over giant internet companies has been tightened. Some foreign investors are hence concerned that China will put more restrictions on corporate behaviors because of the goal of common prosperity. How does China see this? How to alleviate the concerns of foreign investors? Premier Li: Common prosperity can only be attained through common efforts. As far as China’s opening-up policy is concerned, there has been no change in our position, and nor will there be a change. Moreover, there are clear-cut stipulations in China’s Foreign Investment Law. If there will be any change, the change will be conducive to China’s greater openness, and to promoting investment and trade.Foreign investors coming to do business in China have developed themselves, and also brought us investment, sales channels and products we need. It benefits us all. Why should we restrict it? I referred to the reform of government functions in previous answers. Under this reform, we highlight the need to streamline administration and delegate power, enhance regulation and upgrade government services. We are opposed to monopoly and unfair competition and will prevent the unregulated expansion of capital. These efforts aim to motivate and support law-abiding businesses, and provide a level playing field for businesses under all types of ownership, and for both domestic and foreign-invested enterprises to compete fairly. We hope all enterprises will grow in a healthy and well-regulated way.China is a very big country, so it is natural for individual cases to exist. But overall, China’s economy has deeply integrated into the world economy. China’s imports and exports in goods now take up more than one third of the country’s GDP. The level of overall impacts of imports on the industrial sector is over 70 percent. For the past 10 years in a row, China has remained the world’s second largest import market, and for the past five consecutive years, the largest trader in goods. On the whole, we are still transitioning from a lower-middle level on industrial chains to medium and high end. However, this also shows that Chinese industries and consumption are upgrading, and there is tremendous market potential and broad space for all types of investment.China has signed with relevant countries the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. The agreement has officially entered into force this year. It creates the world’s largest free trade area. We will make the most of this opportunity and continue to advance free trade. We will treat state-owned enterprises, privately-held firms and foreign invested enterprises as equals and make continued efforts to make China a popular destination for global foreign investment.I can tell you clearly that no matter how the international environment may change, China will keep to the course of wider openness, just as courses of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers will not reverse. Over the past four decades, China has all along developed itself in the course of reform and opening up. We will actively pursue anything that is conducive to high-level opening-up of this country. We will firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, as this is necessary for our own development.It has been 40-plus years since China started opening-up. Through opening-up, China has developed itself, and brought benefits to its people and to the world. We will not and must not close this door of opportunity. The Press Conference was held via video link between the main venue, the Golden Hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People, and the Press Center for the NPC and CPPCC Sessions at Media Center Hotel. It lasted for about 130 minutes.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the High-level Segment of the 49th Session ofThe United Nations Human Rights Council28 February 2022Mr. President,Dear Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of the Chinese government at the 49th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.To ensure full enjoyment of human rights by all is an unremitting pursuit of humanity. In a world of rapid development where human rights awareness has taken hold, we are more able and better positioned than ever before to promote and protect human rights. That said, the COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc around the world, exacerbating poverty and inequality. The global human rights cause is facing further grave challenges.Promoting and protecting human rights is the shared cause of all countries. As such, China believes we should act as:First, true champions of human rights. The UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have set a lofty goal for the global human rights cause. It falls on every country to keep exploring an effective way to achieve this goal. Human rights have historical, specific and practical contexts, and the human rights cause can only be advanced in light of each country’s reality and its people’s needs. The economic, political, social, cultural and environmental rights of all should be advanced in a coordinated manner to promote and achieve well-rounded human development.Second, staunch guardians of people’s interests. A happy life for all is the biggest human right. A country’s human rights are essentially gauged by whether its people’s aspirations for a better life are satisfied; whether their needs, concerns and expectations are addressed; and whether they enjoy a growing sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. It is essential to put the people front and center and deliver more benefits of national governance and development to all people more fairly, making sure that no one is left behind.Third, positive contributors to common development. Without development, there would be no human rights to speak of, nor could the rights enjoyed by the people be sustainable. President Xi Jinping has put forth the Global Development Initiative (GDI), committing China to working with the UN and all countries to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The GDI is yet another public good China provides for the development of the global human rights cause. It has been endorsed and supported by the UN and up to 100 countries.Fourth, firm defenders of equity and justice. In judging whether human rights are upheld in a country, one cannot use other countries’ standards, still less apply double standards or use human rights as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries. We need to steadfastly promote greater democracy and rule of law in international relations, follow true multilateralism, and steer global human rights governance toward greater fairness, equity and inclusiveness. The Human Rights Council needs to uphold the principles of non-selectiveness and non-politicization. It must not be reduced to a stage for political confrontation.Mr. President,Colleagues,Respecting and protecting human rights is the unremitting pursuit of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In 2021, we solemnly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC. With the lifting of 770 million rural poor out of poverty, China brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty. We realized a moderately prosperous society in all respects and pioneered a new and uniquely Chinese path to modernization. Throughout our fight against COVID-19, we put the people and human lives first, writing a most inspiring chapter in the protection of every person’s life and health. Going forward, China will continue to steadfastly pursue a human rights development path that meets the trend of the times and suits its national conditions. We will continue to uphold a human rights philosophy that puts people front and center, develop the whole-process people’s democracy, promote common prosperity for all, and safeguard the human rights of the Chinese people at a higher level. We will continue to take an active part in UN human rights endeavors by making China’s voice heard and contributing China’s part to this worthy cause.Some forces with ulterior motives have kept hyping up matters relating to China’s Xinjiang. I must point out that over the past six decades and more, the Xinjiang region’s economic output has expanded by 160 times and per capita GDP by 30 times. The Uyghur population there has surged from 2.2 million to around 12 million, with life expectancy across Xinjiang rising from 30 years to 74.7 years. In the Xinjiang region, there is a mosque for every 530 Muslims, a rate higher than many Western or Muslim countries. The claims of “genocide”, “forced labor” and “religious oppression” are sheer lies. Xinjiang’s door is open, and we welcome people from all over the world who harbor no bias to come to Xinjiang for visits and exchanges. China also welcomes the visit by High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet to China, including a trip to Xinjiang, in the near future.Since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland, the central government of China has fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms according to law than under British colonial rule. Hong Kong’s transformation from chaos to governance in recent years is ample proof that the enactment and implementation of the National Security Law has filled a legal vacuum in Hong Kong and the Law better protects the rights and freedoms of the people. Improvement of Hong Kong’s electoral system, which reflects the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong, has better promoted the sound development of Hong Kong’s democratic system. Nearly three million Hong Kong residents have voluntarily signed a petition in support of the National Security Law, and 70 percent of Hong Kong’s residents are happy with the current state of affairs.No one can claim to be perfect in human rights protection; there is always room for improvement. China is ready to engage in human rights exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Nevertheless, we do not accept self-styled “lecturers” on human rights and reject stoking bloc confrontation in the name of human rights.Mr. President,Colleagues,A week ago, the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, which had captured so much attention worldwide, drew to a successful conclusion. The Paralympic Winter Games will take place soon in Beijing. China has presented to the world a streamlined, safe and splendid Games, living up to the Olympic motto of “Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together” and, equally important, instilling a sense of confidence and strength into a world overshadowed by the pandemic. Let us unite behind humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, jointly advance the global human rights cause, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.I wish this session of the Human Rights Council positive outcomes.Thank you.
                

                Video Address by State Councilor Wang YiAt the Meeting in Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary ofthe Shanghai Communiqué28 February 2022Secretary Li Qiang,Dr. Henry Kissinger,Friends,Distinguished Guests,It gives me great pleasure to attend the Meeting in Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Shanghai Communiqué and, together with people from both countries, walk through again that ice-breaking journey, draw experience from history, and seek inspirations for the road ahead. Let me begin by extending congratulations on the convening of this meeting.Fifty years ago today, right in the Jinjiang Hotel where you are gathering, China and the United States jointly issued the Shanghai Communiqué. It thus ended the prolonged estrangement between the two countries, and started the process toward normalization of China-U.S. relations. It signified the willingness of two major countries with different social systems to co-exist in peace and marked the beginning of structural transformation in international relations.Guided by the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué, China and the United States have achieved a series of major progress in their relations. The two countries, once at war with each other, have established 50 pairs of sister provinces/states and 233 pairs of sister cities. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 300 flights shuttled between the two countries every week, and over five million travels were made across the Pacific every year. China-U.S. business ties, once negligible, expanded to U.S.$750 billion in bilateral trade and U.S.$240 billion in two-way investment. From tackling terrorism, financial crises and Ebola, to providing leadership in the signing of the JCPOA and the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on climate change, China and the United States did many great things benefiting the world through their cooperation.As a Chinese saying goes, “When drinking water from the well, one shall not forget those who dug it.” At this moment, we should pay high tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Richard Nixon, Dr. Henry Kissinger, and other Chinese and U.S. leaders of the older generation. And we would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude to people from all sectors who have long committed themselves to China-U.S. friendship and cooperation.Friends,The China-U.S. relationship, kicked off by the Shanghai Communiqué, has gone through 50 years of development with twists and turns. To get a correct understanding of the Communiqué’s spirit will help us see more clearly why the ice in the relationship thawed and barriers were removed, and know how the relationship can forge ahead.History tells us that by following the trend of the times, we can make the right strategic choice. The issuance of the Shanghai Communiqué shook the world, and also changed the world. Chinese and U.S. leaders of the older generation discerned keenly the expectation of the world for easing international tensions, and acted on the aspiration of the Chinese and American peoples for peace and friendship between the two countries. With great political courage, they made the historic handshake across the vastest ocean in the world. Half a century later, the fundamental logic that prompted the two countries to walk toward each other remains unchanged.History tells us that by seeking common ground while reserving differences, we can attain peaceful co-existence between countries with different social systems. The two sides “agreed to disagree” in the Shanghai Communiqué, thus making their agreement even more significant. This creative practice in the history of diplomacy provided a useful reference for the establishment and growth of relations between countries with different systems. The older generation of leaders in both countries realized that despite their differences, neither side had the intention to change the other. Both sides hoped to see that the two countries could grow in parallel and conduct cooperation based on shared interests. This is an important spirit embodied in the Shanghai Communiqué. It remains valid 50 years on today.History tells us that by following the basic norms of international relations, we can build real guardrails for China-U.S. relations. The Taiwan question is the core issue in the Shanghai Communiqué, and the one-China principle is the cornerstone of China-U.S. relations. The Communiqué underscores that countries, regardless of their social systems, should all abide by the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. This fully echoes the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It worked in the past, it is relevant now, and it should be upheld in the future.Friends,The China-U.S. relationship is facing daunting challenges rarely seen since the establishment of the diplomatic ties. This has also caused the international community to worry deeply about the resurgence of a divided world. An important reason for this situation is that the principles and spirit established by the Shanghai Communiqué have not been truly followed.China and the United States once again need to make a historic choice — to continue with peaceful co-existence, or to veer into conflict and confrontation; to go on with openness and cooperation, or to turn back into seclusion and antagonism? In fact, the right answer is already enshrined right there in the Shanghai Communiqué.During his virtual meeting with President Joe Biden last November, President Xi Jinping put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation, laying out the framework for future growth of China-U.S. relations. President Biden responded positively, stating that the United States does not seek a new Cold War or to change China’s system, the revitalization of U.S. alliances is not anti-China, the United States does not support “Taiwan independence”, and it has no intention to have a conflict with China. These important common understandings between the two presidents are not just a furtherance of historical experience. Moreover, they are also new and creative advances that conform with the trend of the times. We urge the United States to reinstate a reasonable and pragmatic China policy, and work with China to put into real actions the common understandings between the presidents as well as President Biden’s statement, in a bid to put China-U.S. relations back on track at an early date.First, we must uphold the one-China principle and consolidate the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. Taiwan has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory since ancient times. In 1943, leaders of China, the United Kingdom and the United States issued the Cairo Declaration, stating clearly that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. In 1945, the Potsdam Declaration, which was aimed at ending World War II, reiterated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. All this shows unequivocally that there is no controversy at all in the international community regarding China’s sovereignty over Taiwan. And Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland in accordance with law.As a legacy of the Chinese civil war and due to the interference by the United States and other external forces, the two sides across the Taiwan Strait have been mired in a special situation of prolonged political antagonism. However, neither China’s national sovereignty nor its territorial integrity has ever been divided. The fact that both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China has never changed. And the entire Chinese people have never stopped their endeavor for national reunification.In 1971, the United States affirmed to China the new principles it would follow with regard to the Taiwan question. They include: the United States would acknowledge that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China; the United States would not repeat the phrase that the status of Taiwan is undetermined; the United States had not supported, and would not support movements for “Taiwan independence”. President Nixon reaffirmed these principles to Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit to China in 1972. That was how the Shanghai Communiqué came into being.It is explicitly stated in the Shanghai Communiqué that the United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position. In the 1978 Joint Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, the United States acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China; and recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. In 1982, the two sides issued the Communiqué of August 17, in which the U.S. side reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China’s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan.” The U.S. side also states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, and that it intends to reduce gradually its sales of arms to Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a final resolution.However, not long after establishing diplomatic ties with China, the United States enacted the so-called “Taiwan Relations Act” and later covertly pieced together the so-called “Six Assurances” to Taiwan. Both of these were unilaterally concocted by the United States. They conflict with U.S. commitments in the three joint communiqués, and violate the one-China principle established by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 which is widely observed by the international community. They are therefore illegal and void from the very beginning.China-U.S. relations, as a state-to-state relationship, can only be built on common understandings reached between both countries, namely the three joint communiqués, rather than on domestic laws or unilateral policies of the United States. That is a universally accepted international rule and a basic principle of international relations. The United States shall not place its domestic legislation above international law.A review of this episode of history shows that facts on the Taiwan question are crystal clear, and that the historic dynamics of the one-China principle are self-evident. History brooks no falsification, and what is right or wrong should not be distorted. The United States should return to the original and true meaning of the one-China principle, honor its political commitments to China, and fulfill its due international obligations. It should stop draining the one-China principle of its essence, and hollowing it out. It should stop encouraging and supporting “Taiwan independence” moves, stop attempting to use the Taiwan question to contain China, and stop saying or doing things that interfere in China’s internal affairs. Only in doing so can peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait be truly maintained and the larger interests of China-U.S. relations be upheld.Second, we must respect each other and ensure the right direction for China-U.S. relations. China and the United States have always been, and will continue to be, countries significantly different in social system, history, culture, and many other areas. That is a fact that no one can change and also reflects the diversity of human civilization. The two sides need to view their relations in a broader perspective and more inclusive attitude, and choose dialogue over confrontation, cooperation over conflict, openness over seclusion, and integration over decoupling.China’s social system and development path are of the firm choice and collective will of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, and the natural course of the evolution of China’s history. China respects the social system of the United States, and never bets against the United States. China hopes that the United States will stay open and confident, and keep growing and making progress. Likewise, the United States should respect China’s development path, and welcome a peaceful, stable and prosperous China. It should abandon its mania for zero-sum games, give up its obsession with encircling and containing China, and break free from the shackles of political correctness. The United States should truly see China as a partner in the course of development, rather than an adversary in power games.Cooperation represents the mainstream of China-U.S. relations. To define the relationship as competition is oversimplification. Even in competition, there should be boundaries, as well as widely recognized international rules based on fairness. This not only enables one country to be faster and stronger, but also makes all countries more united for a shared future. Even if there is competition, it should be about who does a better job in running the country and who contributes more to the world.Third, we must pursue win-win cooperation and promote the development and prosperity of both countries. At present, China and the United States are both facing new circumstances for development. For China to realize high-quality development and common prosperity for all, and for the Unites States to rebuild the middle class, cooperation is the best choice for both sides. The world is big enough to accommodate the development of both China and the United States. And it expects the two countries to strive for win-win results, and achieve all-win with all other countries.China is ready to work with the United States to fully bring out our comparative strengths, expand practical cooperation in such areas as trade, investment, energy and infrastructure, and steadily make our cooperation list longer. China will continue to comprehensively deepen reform. We will share development opportunities with the world through a shorter negative list, better business environment and greater institutional opening-up. We welcome more active involvement by U.S. firms in China’s new development paradigm featuring dual circulations. The United States should also take the lead in building an open world economy and observing international economic and trade rules, and provide a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory market environment for businesses from all countries, including China.Amity between the people holds the key to good relations between countries. People-to-people exchanges serve as a bridge for greater mutual understanding between our two peoples. We should promote the engagement, communication, exchanges and cooperation at all levels and in all areas. We should step up the exchange at sub-national levels and between cities, peoples, think tanks, media and businesses, ignite our people’s enthusiasm for interactions, and strengthen the bond of friendship between China and the United States.Fourth, we must shoulder responsibilities as major countries and provide the world with more public goods. Global challenges call for global cooperation. China and the United States, as major countries, need to stand up to the mission, and play due roles.The two countries can join hands to provide more vaccines for Africa and the rest of the developing world, with a view to building a shield for immunity and contributing to a global victory against COVID-19. We need to maintain macroeconomic policy coordination, inject greater confidence and resilience to the global economy, and bolster solid recovery from the pandemic. We can work together to address the climate crisis, protect nature, and realize green, low-carbon and sustainable development worldwide. China is open to U.S. participation in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative. We are also ready to consider coordinating with the Build Back Better World initiative of the United States to provide more quality public goods for the world.China and the United States jointly stated in the Shanghai Communiqué that “neither should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region”. Today, this statement remains as relevant as ever. China has not, does not and will not seek any hegemony, and neither should the United States. The Asia-Pacific region, where the two countries’ interests are most interwoven and their interactions most frequent and close, should well become a demonstration field of building mutual trust and cooperation, rather than a backyard where one pursues sphere of influence, let alone a wrestling ground for confrontation or conflict. The United States should stop initiating bloc confrontation and developing small, exclusive circles in the region. It should work with China and other regional countries to build a big Asia-Pacific family featuring openness and inclusiveness, innovation-driven growth, greater connectivity, and mutually beneficial cooperation.Friends,Distinguished Guests,Both the Chinese and American peoples are great peoples. Since the door of China-U.S. relations has been opened, it should not be closed again. Since the world has emerged from the Cold War, it should not see the descending of another iron curtain. Standing at a new historical starting point, we need to draw wisdom from the Shanghai Communiqué, follow the guidance of the important common understandings between the two presidents, and find the right way for China-U.S. relations under the new circumstances on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, so as to deliver benefits to both countries and the world. And that is the due responsibilities and obligations of China and the United States.Thank you!
                

                IOC President Thomas Bach,Dear Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,It gives me great pleasure to meet so many old and new friends in Beijing as the Chinese people celebrate the Spring Festival, the start of the lunar new year. Let me begin by extending, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in the name of my wife and myself, a warm welcome to all the distinguished guests travelling to China and attending the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. I sincerely thank all governments, peoples and international organizations that care about and support the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. In particular, I wish to express my appreciation to all the friends present here who have overcome difficulties and inconveniences caused by COVID-19 and come all the way to Beijing to cheer for the Olympic Winter Games and for China.Last night, the Beijing Olympic Winter Games officially opened at China’s National Stadium. After 14 years, the Olympic cauldron has been lit once again in Beijing, making the city the world’s first to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Committed to organizing a green, inclusive, open and clean Games, China has made every effort to counter the impact of COVID-19, earnestly fulfilled its solemn pledge to the international community, and ensured the smooth opening of the Beijing Olympic Winter Games as scheduled.Greater public participation in winter sport contributes to the Olympic Movement. By preparing for and organizing the Olympic Winter Games and promoting Olympic winter sport, China has popularized winter sport among the ordinary people, achieved the goal of engaging 300 million Chinese in sport on snow and ice, and made new contribution to the cause of Olympism worldwide.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Since ancient times, the Olympic Movement has carried humanity’s aspirations for peace, solidarity and progress.— We shall keep in mind the original aspiration of the Olympic Movement and jointly uphold world peace. The Olympic Movement was born for the sake of peace and has thrived thanks to peace. The Olympic Truce Resolution adopted last December by consensus at the United Nations General Assembly, calling for promoting peace through sport, represents the common aspiration of the international community. We need to uphold mutual respect, equality, dialogue and consultation, strive to bridge differences and eliminate conflict, and work together for a world of durable peace.— We shall promote the spirit of the Olympic Movement and meet the common challenges facing the international community through solidarity. The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging, while global issues including climate change and terrorism keep emerging. The international community should stand closer together. The only way for all countries to address the various challenges effectively is to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and work together for a shared future. We need to practice true multilateralism, uphold the international system centered on the United Nations and the international order underpinned by international law, and work together to build an international family of harmony and cooperation.— We shall act on the purpose of the Olympic Movement and continuously pursue human progress. The Olympic Movement aims to achieve well-rounded human development. We need to follow the trend of the times, stay true to humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, promote exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,To borrow a Chinese poetic line, “Out goes the old year with the sound of firecrackers; in comes the new with the warmth of wine and spring breeze.” China has just entered the Year of the Tiger according to the lunar calendar. Tiger is a symbol of strength, courage and fearlessness. I wish all Olympic athletes excellent performance with the strength of the tiger. I am confident that with the joint efforts of us all, Beijing 2022 will surely go down in history as a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games.To conclude, I propose a toast:To the dynamic development of the Olympic Movement;To humanity’s noble cause of peace and development; andTo the health of all distinguished guests and your families.Cheers!
                

                Your Excellencies Ambassadors,Members of the Diplomatic Corps,Representatives of International Organizations,Friends,Greetings to you all. On behalf of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I would like to convey to you, your families and your colleagues our sincere regards and best wishes as we ring in the Lunar New Year.For the world, 2021 was full of turbulence and challenges. At the same time, it also gave good grounds for peace and hope.COVID-19 continued to rage across the globe throughout the year. New variants such as Delta and Omicron emerged one after another, putting life and health around the world in peril. Meanwhile, the international community, through joint efforts, expanded vaccine distribution and accelerated pharmaceutical research and development, showing us the light at the end of the tunnel to defeat the pandemic.Throughout the year, the world economy continued to struggle against the shock wave of the pandemic, which caused problems for many countries in people’s livelihood, employment and even political stability. Meanwhile, countries showed a stronger faith in enhancing cooperation and getting over the difficult time together. International trade made a robust rebound, and technological innovation advanced at a faster pace, bringing economies across the world onto the path of recovery.Throughout the year, the international situation continued to stagger, evolve, and transform. A certain country attempted to draw lines based on values and ideologies, and stoke division and confrontation in the name of democracy and human rights, casting clouds of a new Cold War over the whole world. Meanwhile, peace and development remained the theme of the times. Solidarity over division and cooperation over confrontation became the shared aspiration and choice of the majority of countries.Faced with the complex international situation in 2021, China continued to bear in mind the interest of the world, shouldered its responsibilities, and made important contributions to the world.We joined wholeheartedly in global cooperation against COVID-19. By the end of 2021, China provided more than two billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations, the largest amount of outbound vaccines given by a single country. That means one out of two vaccines administered around the world was made in China. We gave priority to cooperation with the developing world. Not long ago, President Xi Jinping announced that China would provide, on top of what it already did, one billion doses of vaccines to Africa and 150 million doses to ASEAN countries.We vigorously promoted world economic development. The steady growth of China’s economy injected strong impetus into world economic recovery. A number of international organizations estimated that in 2021 China remained the largest contributor to global economic growth with a solid share of more than 25 percent. President Xi Jinping solemnly presented the Global Development Initiative, providing a new public good for effectively tackling post-COVID challenges and realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Initiative has been well received and supported by international organizations such as UN agencies and nearly 100 countries.We firmly defended international fairness and justice. We, together with the majority of countries in the world, took the right side of history. We jointly opposed unilateralism, power politics and bullying. We vigorously advocated true multilateralism and the common values of humanity. We actively mediated for peaceful settlement of regional hotspot issues. And we firmly upheld the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law.Friends,Last year marked the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). You all witnessed this great, historic moment together with the 1.4 billion Chinese people. Many of you even made important visits to “red historic sites” across China, gaining a more truthful and comprehensive understanding of China and the CPC. This year, the CPC will hold its 20th National Congress, and the Chinese people will embark on a new journey of development under the CPC’s leadership.As President Xi Jinping pointed out, the CPC is a party that strives for the wellbeing of the Chinese people, and it is also a party that endeavors for progress of humanity. In the new year, China will continue to hold high the banner of a community with a shared future for mankind, and work hand in hand with all countries that love peace and uphold justice to make new and greater contribution to safeguarding world peace and prosperity.We will celebrate the Winter Olympics with all countries in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. In a few days, the Olympics will enter “Beijing Time”. We have the confidence and capability to overcome distractions and make the Winter Games a grand global event that enhances mutual understanding and friendship and brings the whole world “together for a shared future”, so as to give all nations greater confidence and strength in battling the pandemic.We will build a line of defense against COVID-19 with all countries in the spirit of mutual assistance. We will continue to make good use of vaccines, the most effective weapon against the virus, support other developing countries in closing the immunization gap, strive to build a global community of health for all, and foster greater synergy for the world to defeat the virus at an early date.We will strengthen friendship and cooperation with all countries in the spirit of mutual respect and mutual trust. We will actively promote coordination, cooperation and amity among major countries, deepen convergence of interests in all areas and people-to-people connectivity with neighboring countries, and strengthen solidarity and friendship with fellow developing countries. We will encourage all countries to strive for greater cooperation and mutual trust and less friction and division, and to deliver more benefits to all peoples.We will promote development and prosperity with all countries in the spirit of mutual benefit and win-win. We will work closely with UN agencies and all countries to synergize our efforts for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and advance the implementation of the Global Development Initiative. We will actively safeguard the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains, pursue deeper and more substantive progress in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and contribute more energy to world economic recovery.Thank you!
                

                Special Address by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 2022 World Economic Forum Virtual Session17 January 2022Professor Klaus Schwab,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Greetings to you all! It is my pleasure to attend this virtual session of the World Economic Forum. In two weeks’ time, China will celebrate the advent of spring in the lunar new year, the Year of the Tiger. In Chinese culture, tiger symbolizes bravery and strength, as the Chinese people often refer to spirited dragon and dynamic tiger, or soaring dragon and leaping tiger. To meet the severe challenges facing humanity, we must “add wings to the tiger” and act with the courage and strength of the tiger to overcome all obstacles on our way forward. We must do everything necessary to clear the shadow of the pandemic and boost economic and social recovery and development, so that the sunshine of hope may light up the future of humanity. The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. These changes, not limited to a particular moment, event, country or region, represent the profound and sweeping changes of our times. As changes of the times combine with the once-in-a-century pandemic, the world finds itself in a new period of turbulence and transformation. How to beat the pandemic and how to build the post-COVID world? These are major issues of common concern to people around the world. They are also major, urgent questions we must give answers to. As a Chinese saying goes, “The momentum of the world either flourishes or declines; the state of the world either progresses or regresses.” The world is always developing through the movement of contradictions; without contradiction, nothing would exist. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times. Notwithstanding all vicissitudes, humanity will move on. We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges. First, we need to embrace cooperation and jointly defeat the pandemic. Confronted by the once-in-a-century pandemic, which will affect the future of humanity, the international community has fought a tenacious battle. Facts have shown once again that amidst the raging torrents of a global crisis, countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which our shared destiny hinges. Small boats may not survive a storm, but a giant ship is strong enough to brave a storm. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the international community, major progress has been made in the global fight against the pandemic. That said, the pandemic is proving a protracted one, resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before. It poses a serious threat to people’s safety and health, and exerts a profound impact on the global economy. Strong confidence and cooperation represent the only right way to defeat the pandemic. Holding each other back or shifting blame would only cause needless delay in response and distract us from the overall objective. Countries need to strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19, carry out active cooperation on research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all. Of particular importance is to fully leverage vaccines as a powerful weapon, ensure their equitable distribution, quicken vaccination and close the global immunization gap, so as to truly safeguard people’s lives, health and livelihoods.China is a country that delivers on its promises. China has already sent over two billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Still, China will provide another one billion doses to African countries, including 600 million doses as donation, and will also donate 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. Second, we need to resolve various risks and promote steady recovery of the world economy. The world economy is emerging from the depths, yet it still faces many constraints. The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted. Commodity prices continue to rise. Energy supply remains tight. These risks compound one another and heighten the uncertainty about economic recovery. The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slam on the brakes or take a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt of it. In the context of ongoing COVID-19 response, we need to explore new drivers of economic growth, new modes of social life and new pathways for people-to-people exchange, in a bid to facilitate cross-border trade, keep industrial and supply chains secure and smooth, and promote steady and solid progress in global economic recovery.Economic globalization is the trend of the times. Though countercurrents are sure to exist in a river, none could stop it from flowing to the sea. Driving forces bolster the river’s momentum, and resistance may yet enhance its flow. Despite the countercurrents and dangerous shoals along the way, economic globalization has never and will not veer off course. Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy. We should guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice, and uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its center. We should make generally acceptable and effective rules for artificial intelligence and digital economy on the basis of full consultation, and create an open, just and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological innovation. This is the way to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy.A common understanding among us is that to turn the world economy from crisis to recovery, it is imperative to strengthen macro-policy coordination. Major economies should see the world as one community, think in a more systematic way, increase policy transparency and information sharing, and coordinate the objectives, intensity and pace of fiscal and monetary policies, so as to prevent the world economy from plummeting again. Major developed countries should adopt responsible economic policies, manage policy spillovers, and avoid severe impacts on developing countries. International economic and financial institutions should play their constructive role to pool global consensus, enhance policy synergy and prevent systemic risks.Third, we need to bridge the development divide and revitalize global development. The process of global development is suffering from severe disruption, entailing more outstanding problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault-lines and a technological divide. The Human Development Index has declined for the first time in 30 years. The world’s poor population has increased by more than 100 million. Nearly 800 million people live in hunger. Difficulties are mounting in food security, education, employment, medicine, health and other areas important to people’s livelihoods. Some developing countries have fallen back into poverty and instability due to the pandemic. Many in developed countries are also living through a hard time.No matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro-policies, realize the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide. We need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, promote international cooperation on climate change in the context of development, and implement the outcomes of COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Developed economies should take the lead in honoring their emissions reduction responsibilities, deliver on their commitment of financial and technological support, and create the necessary conditions for developing countries to address climate change and achieve sustainable development.Last year, I put forward a Global Development Initiative at the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the pressing challenges faced by developing countries. The Initiative is a public good open to the whole world, which aims to form synergy with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and boost common development across the world. China stands ready to work with all partners to jointly translate the Initiative into concrete actions and make sure that no country is left behind in this process.Fourth, we need to discard Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes. Our world today is far from being tranquil; rhetorics that stoke hatred and prejudice abound. Acts of containment, suppression or confrontation arising thereof do all harm, not the least good, to world peace and security. History has proved time and again that confrontation does not solve problems; it only invites catastrophic consequences. Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one; they ultimately hurt the interests of others as well as one’s own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history. Naturally, countries have divergences and disagreements between them. Yet a zero-sum approach that enlarges one’s own gain at the expense of others will not help. Acts of single-mindedly building “exclusive yards with high walls” or “parallel systems”, of enthusiastically putting together exclusive small circles or blocs that polarize the world, of overstretching the concept of national security to hold back economic and technological advances of other countries, and of fanning ideological antagonism and politicizing or weaponizing economic, scientific and technological issues, will gravely undercut international efforts to tackle common challenges.The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation. Different countries and civilizations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences.We should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics. Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Last year, the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding. Through a century of tenacious struggle, the CPC has rallied and led the Chinese people in accomplishing remarkable achievements in the advancement of the nation and betterment of people’s lives. We have realized a moderately prosperous society in all respects and won the battle against poverty, both according to plan, and found a historic solution to ending absolute poverty. Now, China is marching on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects.— China will stay committed to pursuing high-quality development. The Chinese economy enjoys a good momentum overall. Last year, our GDP grew by around eight percent, achieving the dual target of fairly high growth and relatively low inflation. Shifts in the domestic and international economic environment have brought tremendous pressure, but the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, characterized by strong resilience, enormous potential and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. We have every confidence in the future of China’s economy.“The wealth of a country is measured by the abundance of its people.” Thanks to considerable economic growth, the Chinese people are living much better lives. Nonetheless, we are soberly aware that to meet people’s aspiration for an even better life, we still have much hard work to do in the long run. China has made it clear that we strive for more visible and substantive progress in the well-rounded development of individuals and the common prosperity of the entire population. We are working hard on all fronts to deliver this goal. The common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism. To use an analogy, we will first make the pie bigger, and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements. As a rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will get a fair share from development, and development gains will benefit all our people in a more substantial and equitable way.— China will stay committed to reform and opening-up. For China, reform and opening-up is always a work in process. Whatever change in the international landscape, China will always hold high the banner of reform and opening-up. China will continue to let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, and see to it that the government better plays its role. We will be steadfast in consolidating and developing the public sector, just as we are steadfast in encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector. We will build a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system, where all businesses enjoy equal status before the law and have equal opportunities in the marketplace. All types of capital are welcome to operate in China in compliance with laws and regulations, and play a positive role for the development of the country. China will continue to expand high-standard opening-up, steadily advance institutional opening-up that covers rules, management and standards, deliver national treatment for foreign businesses, and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. With the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) on 1 January this year, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations and deepen economic and trade ties with other RCEP parties. China will also continue to work for the joining of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), with a view to further integrating into the regional and global economy and achieving mutual benefit and win-win results. — China will stay committed to promoting ecological conservation. As I have said many times, we should never grow the economy at the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation, which is like draining a pond to get fish; nor should we sacrifice growth to protect the environment, which is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Guided by our philosophy that clean waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver, China has carried out holistic conservation and systematic governance of its mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts. We do everything we can to conserve the ecological system, intensify pollution prevention and control, and improve the living and working environment for our people. China is now putting in place the world’s largest national parks system. Last year, we successfully hosted COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity, contributing China’s share to a clean and beautiful world. Achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality are the intrinsic requirements of China’s own high-quality development and a solemn pledge to the international community. China will honor its word and keep working toward its goal. We have unveiled an Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030, to be followed by implementation plans for specific sectors such as energy, industry and construction. China now has the world’s biggest carbon market and biggest clean power generation system: the installed capacity of renewable energy has exceeded one billion kilowatts, and the construction of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts is well under way. Carbon peak and carbon neutrality cannot be realized overnight. Through solid and steady steps, China will pursue an orderly phase-down of traditional energy in the course of finding reliable substitution in new energy. This approach, which combines phasing out the old and bringing in the new, will ensure steady economic and social development. China will also actively engage in international cooperation on climate and jointly work for a complete transition to a greener economy and society. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, Davos is known as a heaven for winter sports. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will open soon. We are confident that China will present a streamlined, safe and splendid Games to the world. The official motto for Beijing 2022 is “Together for a Shared Future”. Indeed, let us join hands with full confidence, and work together for a shared future. Thank you.

Wang YiState Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Manila Forum for China-Philippines Relations17 January 2022Your ExcellencyGloria Macapagal Arroyo,Your Excellency Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin,Ministers,Friends,Good afternoon!It is my great pleasure to join you again at theManila Forum for China-Philippines Relations. A year ago, HerExcellency Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and I announced together thelaunch of the Forum in Manila. I am very glad to see it growing rapidlyduring the past year and its role in promoting the mutual trust andcooperation between our two peoples. I would like to salute YourExcellency Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and people from all sectors in bothcountries who have worked so hard for China-Philippines friendship.China and the Philippines are neighbors facing each other across thesea and partners through thick and thin. Not long ago, when thePhilippines was hit by a super typhoon, President Xi Jinping promptlyexpressedhis sympathies and support, and the Chinese government wasamong the first to provide emergency assistance. The Philippine peopleare strong and resilient. We believe that under the leadership of PresidentDuterte and the Philippine government, people in the affected areas willrebuild their home at an early date. To support their reconstruction, Iwould like to announce that the Chinese government has decided toprovide another 100 million RMB yuan of grant to the Philippines.Friends,China's friendly interactions with the Philippines date back to over amillennium ago. China brings to the Philippines not colonization or war, but cooperation and friendship. The story about the King of Sulu's visit toChina was a historical epitome of our friendship. While in office, President Arroyo made many solid efforts to enhance China-Philippinesfriendship. After taking office, President Duterte made the strategicdecision to improve relations with China, and rainbows appeared inChina-Philippines relations after the rainstorms. Facts have proved thatthe decision fully conforms with the fundamental interests of thePhilippines and its people, the common interests of China and thePhilippines, and the trend toward peace and development in the region. Iam confident that people with insight from our two countries will keep tothis right direction and write more splendid chapters of China-Philippinesfriendship.Looking ahead, China will continue to pursue a policy to foster anamicable, secure and prosperous neighborhood, and stay committed to theprinciple of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in itsneighborhood diplomacy. We will promote greater solidarity andcooperation with the Philippines.China will join hands with the Philippines to prevail over thepandemic.China has provided the Philippines with over 57 million dosesof COVID vaccines. We will continue to help meet the Philippines'needfor vaccines, and work with you on developing effective medicines andbuilding up public health capacity to eventually defeat the virus.China will join hands with the Philippines to speed updevelopment and rejuvenation.The Belt and Road Initiative and the"Build, Build, Build"Strategy are now seamlessly coordinated. Irrigation, dam and telecommunications projects are moving ahead at a faster pace, and many follow-up cooperation programs such as railways and bridgesare in the pipeline. China has also supported the Philippines in importantundertakings such as the building of drug rehabilitation centers, post-conflict reconstruction in Marawi, and bridge projects in Manila. Asthe largest trading partner and export market of the Philippines, Chinawill keep its doors open to more Philippine agricultural products andmake more investment in the country, with a view to contributing to yourefforts in accelerating industrialization and modernization andcapacity-building for self-generated development.China will join hands with the Philippines to properly handle theSouth China Sea issue. We each have our respective claims andpositions. Before an agreement can be reached, it is important that we putthe issue in a proper place and prevent it from affecting or even takinghostage the overall bilateral relationship. Stressing only one side's claimsand imposing one's own will on the other is not a proper way forneighbors to treat each other, and it also goes against the Orientalphilosophy of how people should get along with each other. China willabsolutely not use its strength to bully smaller countries, and we neverbelieve in the winner-takes-all approach. We hope to work with thePhilippines to find ways to properly manage and resolve the issue in thespirit of goodwill and pragmatism. We need to come up with the resolveas soon as possible to advance joint development without prejudice toeither side's rights and claims, so that we can turn the South China Seaissue from a challenge into an opportunity and a positive factor conduciveto the development of the Philippines and the friendship between our twopeoples.China will join hands with the Philippines to maintain peace andstability in the region.East Asia, the shared home for China and thePhilippines, is the region with the greatest development potential in theworld. This has not come by easily, and should be doubly cherished. However, some forces outside the region are trying to frustrate this goodmomentum with repeated provocations. As two important members of theregion, China and the Philippines should stay committed to anindependent foreign policy, uphold the ASEAN-centered regionalcooperationarchitecture, deepen the China-ASEAN comprehensivestrategic partnership, and contribute to the stability and prosperity of theregion.Friends,The year 2022 is important for both China and the Philippines. Chinawill soon enter the "Winter Olympics Time", and the Communist Party ofChina will hold its 20th National Congress later in the year. ThePhilippines also has important domestic political agenda this year. Standing at a new historical starting point, let us always bear in mind thewellbeing of our two peoples, commit to steering our friendly relations inthe right direction, follow the course charted by our top leaders, removedisturbances, deepen cooperation, and jointly usher in an even betterfuture for China-Philippines relations.Thank you.
                

                By Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister ofThe People’s Republic of China IThe year 2021 has been a year of historic importance for both China and the world.This year, the Chinese people have forged ahead in great strides and achieved historic changes. We celebrated the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Over the past century, the Party has led the people in writing a remarkable chapter in the history of human development, and the Chinese nation has achieved the tremendous transformation from standing up to growing prosperous and becoming strong. General Secretary Xi Jinping solemnly declared that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. At its Sixth Plenary Session, the 19th CPC Central Committee fully reviewed the Party’s major achievements and historical experience over the past century, and sounded a clarion call for forging ahead on a new journey and making still greater contributions in the new era. While responding with composure to changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, we have made new advances in fostering a new development paradigm and pursuing high-quality development, and got off to a good start in implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan. The over 1.4 billion Chinese people, filled with an even stronger sense of self-confidence and self-reliance, have unleashed a mighty force for building China into a modern socialist country.This year, human society has experienced turbulence and transformation and moved forward with fortitude in a changing world. In 2021, the world has witnessed a persistent and unchecked pandemic, accelerating changes unseen in a century, and a period of turbulence and transformation. The persistent impact of the pandemic, setbacks in global economic recovery, mounting difficulties standing in the way of development and widening North-South gap have all created new areas of weakness, poverty belts, and sources of instability. With human society facing multiple crises, global governance undergoing profound changes and the international order confronted with severe challenges, countries around the world are looking for answers and humanity is required to make the right choice.Standing at the crossroads of our times, we have observed two opposite trends at play. One is to revert to a Cold War mentality, provoke division and antagonism, and stoke confrontation between blocs. The other is to act out of the common good of humanity to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, advocate openness and win-win results, and promote equality and respect. The tug of war between these two trends will shape the future of humanity and our planet in a profound way.This year, China has actively pursued its diplomatic agenda despite difficulties and steered the changes of our times. Under the firm guidance of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s broad vision and overall leadership, China has conducted diplomacy with a global vision to serve the nation and our people. We have opened up new vistas amid global changes, turned crises into opportunities in a complex world, and fostered an enabling external environment through struggle as well as cooperation. We have all along stood on the right side of history, and on the side of human progress, the side of international equity and justice, and the side of the vast developing countries. We have chosen cooperation over confrontation, openness over isolation, mutual benefit over zero-sum game, and equality over power politics and bullying. Together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, we have endeavored to keep the wheels of human development rolling toward a brighter future.IILooking beyond the horizon, we have worked to steer the world in the right direction amid turbulence and changes. General Secretary Xi Jinping, with a keen understanding of the changing international dynamics and the trend of the times, has put forward a number of major initiatives, including building a global community of health for all, a community of life for man and nature, and a global community of development with a shared future. These proposals have enriched, in keeping with our times, the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. He is personally involved in the planning and successful conduct of head-of-state diplomacy. In 2021, General Secretary Xi Jinping had 79 meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders and heads of international organizations, and chaired and attended 40 important diplomatic events via video link, thus helping expand the convergence of interests in win-win cooperation and forge strong synergy for building a community with a shared future for mankind. The endeavor to build a community with a shared future for mankind, a vision radiating the light of truth in a changing world, made progress across the board, from Latin America and the Caribbean to the Middle East, from BRICS to the United Nations (UN), and from ecological conservation to digital governance. This vision, having been included in resolutions of the UN General Assembly for five years in a row, serves as a great banner pointing the way forward for our times and humanity.Keeping to the right way forward, we have built important consensus for upholding the international order. Facing the contest between true and fake multilateralism, we have held high the torch of true multilateralism, and commemorated the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the UN. We declared unequivocally that in today’s world, there is but one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core; there is but one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law; and there is but one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We have laid bare the nature of fake multilateralism in its various manifestations, and rejected attempts to form exclusive blocs under the pretext of multilateralism, to impose one’s own rules on the international community under the excuse of a “rules-based order”, and to divide the world along ideological lines. We have also firmly promoted greater democracy and rule of law in international relations. Facing the false juxtaposition of democracy versus authoritarianism fabricated by a certain country, we have set forth China’s success in practicing whole-process people’s democracy, safeguarded the true spirit of democracy, and promoted a right understanding of what democracy is about. We have refuted false narratives to set the record straight, and revealed the truth about a self-important, “superior” model of democracy. As a result, to oppose monopolizing the definition of democracy or dividing the world along ideological lines is becoming the call of more people around the world. Fulfilling our responsibility as a major country, we have made significant contribution to global COVID response. We have stayed the course of solidarity and cooperation, launching the Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative and the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation. We have been a pace-setter for closer international cooperation, upheld the primary feature of vaccines as a global public good, and stayed at the forefront of efforts for equitable distribution of vaccines. We have endeavored to bridge the vaccine divide. China was among the first to commit to making COVID vaccines a global public good, to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines, and to start joint production with other developing countries. To date, we have provided over two billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations, accounting for one-third of the total number of vaccines administered outside China. Chinese vaccines have become “vaccines for the people”, “vaccines of the world”, and “vaccines truly accessible”. We have provided badly needed assistance to other developing countries, pledging another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa and an additional donation of 150 million doses to ASEAN countries, and carrying out joint production in 20 countries. We have raced against time and taken multi-pronged actions to see that vaccines are delivered to those in need no matter where they are. We have upheld the “golden rule” of taking a science-based approach and rejected politicization of origins tracing. China and the World Health Organization (WHO) have released a joint report on the origins of the virus, demonstrating a commitment to openness, transparency and international cooperation. Over 80 countries have written to the WHO to express their opposition to politicization of origins tracing. More than 25 million Chinese have joined the online petition calling for the WHO to investigate the Fort Detrick bio-lab. While the coronavirus is the common enemy of mankind, the “political virus” has fueled the spread of the pandemic. In the end, both the coronavirus and the political virus will be defeated by humanity.Committed to openness and inclusiveness, we have added momentum to promoting economic recovery. In face of rising protectionism, General Secretary Xi Jinping points out explicitly that openness and integration is the overall historical trend. We must dismantle not build walls, we must remain true to openness and oppose isolation, and we must pursue integration and reject decoupling, in order to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. We have focused on development as the solution to all problems. General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forth a Global Development Initiative, which aims to complement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and create synergy among countries to achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development. The Initiative has received endorsement and support from the UN and many other international organizations as well as some 100 countries in the world. We have facilitated the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, taking new steps toward regional cooperation in the face of protectionist headwinds. We have opened up China’s economy at higher standards and shared China’s opportunities with the rest of the world through a shorter negative list, better business environment and greater institutional opening-up. The fourth China International Import Expo (CIIE) drew a record number of 127 countries and regions and 3,000 companies. We have overcome various difficulties to further advance Belt and Road cooperation. The third symposium on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has drawn up a new blueprint. The China-Europe Railway Express has become an anchor of stability for global supply chains. The China-Laos Railway has helped Laos achieve its dream of becoming a land-linked country. With the support of 145 countries and 32 international organizations, the BRI is fast becoming “a belt of prosperity” benefiting the world and “a road of happiness” benefiting all peoples.Deepening strategic communication, we have added impetus to the steady growth of China’s relations with other major countries. The Chinese and Russian presidents have had four telephone conversations and virtual meetings, and officially announced the extension of the Treaty of Good-neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, enriching the traditional China-Russia friendship in the new era. China and Russia have advanced common development through all-round, practical cooperation, and upheld global stability through substantial strategic coordination. This relationship has set a good example for major-country relations and interactions between neighbors, and become a pillar of international fairness and justice. In his two telephone conversations and one virtual meeting with President Joe Biden, General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly outlined a strategic framework of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation for China-US relations, charting the course for the sound and steady growth of this relationship. We have set clear “three red lines” and put forward “two lists of key concerns”, urging the US not to challenge China’s path and system, obstruct China’s development process, or infringe on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ms. Meng Wanzhou’s safe return to China after being held illegally for over 1,000 days represents a powerful example of justice prevailing in the end. China-EU relations have been further advanced amid challenges. General Secretary Xi Jinping has attended two video summits with French and German leaders, and a China-CEEC Summit has been held via video link; the China-EU agreement on geographical indications has come into force; steady progress has been made in flagship Belt and Road projects; and China and the EU have achieved positive outcomes in such areas as upholding multilateralism, enhancing global governance, and tackling climate change.Working in concert, we have pursued common development and rejuvenation with our neighbors and other developing countries. We and our neighbors have deepened the consensus on building a shared future, and made further progress through joint development efforts. General Secretary Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN countries have cerebrated the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations and announced the elevation of the China-ASEAN relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, marking a big step forward in China-ASEAN relations. The two sides have reached common understandings on promoting synergy between the BRI and the priority areas of cooperation outlined in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Solid and substantive progress has been made in building the Lancang-Mekong Development Belt, further driving home that drinking from the same river, people in this region share a closely linked future. Premier Li Keqiang has attended the leaders’ meetings on East Asian cooperation and explored new potential in cooperation on digital economy, blue economy and green economy. Iran has been admitted to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the first offline foreign ministers’ meeting between China and five Central Asian countries (C+C5) has been held. China’s friendship and cooperation with the DPRK, the ROK and Mongolia have maintained good momentum, serving as positive factors in regional stability. Chinese and Japanese leaders have reached common understandings on developing a bilateral relationship that answers the call of the new era. China and India have effectively managed and controlled frictions in certain border areas, under a shared commitment to improving bilateral relations. China has worked for the launch of a new mechanism of the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on the Afghan Issue among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, and opened an air freight corridor for Afghan pine nuts, bringing real benefits to the people of Afghanistan. We have encouraged the new Afghan administration to follow a policy of inclusiveness, counter-terrorism and good-neighborliness and to fight all terrorist organizations including the East Turkistan Islamic Movement. China has supported Myanmar in working with ASEAN to implement the five-point consensus and in firmly opposing undue external intervention. We have made active mediation efforts to help deescalate the situation, and encouraged the restart of the democratic transition process in Myanmar.We have responded to the developing countries’ aspiration for rejuvenation, and opened up new scope for South-South cooperation. Cooperation between China and Africa has reached a new climax. While attending the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation via video link, President Xi Jinping highlighted the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation featuring sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, progress with the times, and openness and inclusiveness. He put forward a four-point proposal for building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, and announced nine programs for cooperation with Africa. This is a new milestone in China-Africa relations. Relations between China and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries have made steady progress. A three-year roadmap for cooperation was formulated at the Third Ministers’ Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum (CCF); high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with LAC countries has been further substantiated; new progress has been made in energy, electricity, transportation, communications and other areas of cooperation; China-LAC trade has remained above US$300 billion for four consecutive years; and more efforts have been made to foster a China-LAC relationship for a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness, and benefits for the people. The strategic partnership between China and Arab states has scaled a new height. China has proposed a five-point initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East, a four-point proposal for the political settlement of the Syrian issue, and a three-point vision for the implementation of the two-state solution, to support and encourage countries in the Middle East to set out on a new path of independence and renewal. China and the League of Arab States (LAS) have issued the China-LAS Cooperation Initiative on Data Security, adding a new dimension to the China-Arab community with a shared future. We have held the first China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, which yielded important outcomes including the setup of a joint emergency supplies reserve, a poverty reduction and development cooperation center, and a climate action cooperation center. The emergency supplies reserve was officially launched early this month. Facts have shown that China is always a staunch member of the developing world. It will keep forging ahead hand in hand with fellow developing countries toward a shared future.Being brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, we have built a strong line of defense for safeguarding national interests. Confronted by various acts of infringements and bullying, we have stayed unflinching and fought back resolutely, demonstrating the self-confidence, self-reliance and perseverance of the Chinese people, and the resolve, determination and integrity of the Chinese nation. In response to the attempt of the Taiwan authorities to seek American support for independence and the intention of a very few countries to use the Taiwan question to contain China, we have issued stern warnings and taken forceful countermeasures, deterring the separatist forces for “Taiwan independence”. We have restored diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, raising the number of countries having diplomatic ties with China to 181 and further consolidating the international consensus on one China. By inviting people from around the world to Xinjiang, we have busted lies and falsehoods with facts. We have resolutely opposed external interference in Hong Kong affairs, and sustained the good momentum of Hong Kong returning to law and order. We have foiled anti-China moves at multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, by presenting to the world China’s achievements in human rights advancement. We have fought back attempts to stir up trouble under the pretext of human rights, and won the overwhelming support of nearly 100 countries. We have successfully rallied 173 countries in co-sponsoring and adopting an Olympic Truce resolution, showcasing strong international support for the Beijing Winter Olympics.Keeping in mind the country’s top priorities, we have done our utmost to serve domestic development and the interests of our people through diplomacy. We have successfully hosted promotion events for Hubei and Tibet, and supported the China International Fair for Trade in Services, the CIIE, and other international events hosted by China, in a bid to build new bridges for different localities to open up wider to the world. We have introduced targeted COVID-19 protocols for incoming travelers prior to their trips to secure the gains in pandemic control at home, and opened “fast tracks” for the travel of essential personnel and “green lanes” for the shipment of emergency COVID-19 supplies to ensure unimpeded domestic and international circulations and to support the fostering of a new development paradigm. We have launched a Spring Sprout program to get Chinese nationals abroad vaccinated against COVID-19, so far benefiting millions in 180 countries. Our consular service hotline 12308, running 24/7 to help Chinese nationals facing difficulties abroad, has received over 500,000 calls this year. Our diplomatic missions abroad have processed about 60,000 consular protection and assistance cases. We have provided risk assessment and alert services around the globe, helped Chinese enterprises and personnel operating overseas enhance security and self-protection capabilities, evacuated Chinese from high-risk areas, responded properly to major terrorist attacks, and worked all-out to rescue Chinese hostages. The China Consular Affairs app has been launched, and a mode of “Internet plus consular services” has been introduced to make consular services more easily accessible.Over the past year, China has conducted diplomacy amid changes unseen in a century, maintained composure and confidence in major-power interactions, and scored a succession of hard-won achievements. This has been made possible with the strong leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the clear guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. As we celebrate the centenary of the Party, a Study Outline for Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy has been published, the development of the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy Studies Center has gained speed, and members of China’s foreign service are studying and implementing at greater depth Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. What we have achieved in China’s diplomacy over the past year fully shows that Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy closely integrates both our historical mission and the trend of our times, both China’s national character and internationalism, and both a Chinese perspective and a global vision. It radiates the light of truth of Marxism, generates the intellectual strength that drives the times forward, and provides the fundamental guidance that we must follow in the long run in conducting major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era.ⅢDespite dramatic changes in the world, justice will always prevail. The more challenges we face, the more imperative it is for us to break waves and forge ahead.The year 2022 will be an important one for global developments, with both crises and opportunities. It is also a critical year for the Chinese people as they strive with confidence toward the second centenary goal. Members of the diplomatic service will rally even more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core and keep in alignment, enhance confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position in both the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole, and firmly uphold the Party Central Committee’s authority and its centralized, unified leadership. We will keep both the domestic and international imperatives in mind and endeavor to foster a more stable and favorable external environment for the great cause of the Party and the country.First, we will make every effort to ensure the success of major and important events. The 20th CPC National Congress will be a most important event in the political life of the Party and the country in 2022. We will endeavor to do a good job on the external front in all directions, present the CPC story to the world, and forestall and defuse external risks and challenges in preparation for the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Party. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games, a big event for winter sports, will draw worldwide attention. We will promote the Olympic spirit of “mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play”, warmly welcome friends from around the world while rejecting the politicization of the Olympics, and work to bring the world greater confidence, joy, courage and strength with a streamlined, safe and splendid Games. Head-of-state diplomacy is the highest form of China’s diplomacy. We will strengthen political planning and ensure good services for home-ground diplomacy and multilateral summits including the BRICS Summit and the CIIE, so that head-of-state diplomacy will fully play its guiding role.Second, we will take proactive steps to tackle the challenges in the post-COVID era. The only way for the world to emerge from the pandemic is by working together. We will continue to promote the spirit of solidarity in fighting COVID-19 and advance the building of a global community of health for all featuring both robust COVID response and heartwarming cooperation. We will actively promote cooperation in vaccines upgrade and drug research, and take effective measures to close the immunization gap. We will uphold global solidarity against the pandemic, improve global public health governance, and work with all other countries to build lines of defense against the virus and create global synergy for responding to pandemics.Third, we will work for the implementation of the two major initiatives on development and cooperation. The Global Development Initiative is a public good for the world. We will work closely with UN agencies and other countries to align the Initiative with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and follow through on cooperation in the eight key areas of the Initiative. We will champion a development-first vision, reinvigorate global development cooperation, promote global economic recovery, and help other developing countries achieve leapfrog development. The Belt and Road Initiative provides the biggest platform for open cooperation. We will work with BRI partners to further deepen and substantiate high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with hard connectivity as the direction, soft connectivity as the support, and people-to-people connectivity as the bond.Fourth, we will expand and deepen global partnerships. We will continue to deepen shoulder-by-shoulder, back-to-back strategic cooperation with Russia, making it a pillar of global stability, a bedrock for peace, and a force for fairness and justice. We will strengthen high-level strategic communication with the EU, focus on the mainstream of dialogue and cooperation, stick to the keynote of mutual benefit, and continue to be partners and not adversaries. We will pursue integrated development with our neighbors and deepen convergence of interests and people-to-people affinity to jointly build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home. We will remain a sincere and reliable partner for other developing countries, support them in building capacity for self-generated development, and defend their legitimate rights to development.Fifth, we will make efforts to bring China-US relations back on the right track. The year 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China. The two countries should review the spirit of that ice-melting trip, follow through on the common understandings reached between the two presidents, observe the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, abide by the three China-US Joint Communiqués, steer America’s China policy back to reason, and bring China-US relations back on the right track. The two sides need to jointly explore how two major countries with different systems, cultures and development stages can coexist in peace, for the good of the people in both countries and around the world. Sixth, we will firmly safeguard China’s core interests. We will resolutely fight off any attempts to infringe upon China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and we will firmly and effectively repulse any moves to undermine the Chinese people’s legitimate rights and interests. We have never been subordinate to anyone, we have never plundered others, and we will never give in to any coercion or blackmail. Taiwan has always been part of China’s territory. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are not to be infringed upon. The general trend toward China’s complete reunification is unstoppable, and China’s resolve to oppose any attempt to create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” is unshakable.In a volatile world, we should stay cool-headed and not be affected by any distractions. Seen in the broader context of human development and progress, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation represents an unstoppable trend. On our new journey in the new era, members of the diplomatic service will follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, to break new ground in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era and make greater contributions to China’s rejuvenation and to human progress.
                

                Dec. 31,On New Year's eve, President Xi Jinping delivered his 2022 New Year Address through China Media Group and the Internet. The following is the full text of the address:My greetings to you all. The year 2022 is approaching. From Beijing, I extend New Year wishes to all of you!The past year has been a year of exceptional significance. We have lived through landmark events in the history of our Party and our country. At the historical convergence of the Two Centenary Goals, we have set out on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects and are making confident strides on the path toward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.From the beginning to the end of the year, the Chinese people have been hard at work in the fields, enterprises, communities, schools, hospitals, barracks and research institutes, among other places. Throughout the year, we have put in our efforts, contributed our part, and received much in return. In the passage of time, we have seen and experienced a resilient and dynamic China, a country with its amicable and respectable people, a country developing rapidly with each passing day, and a country making continual progress in all its undertakings.On July 1, we solemnly celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Standing on the Tian'anmen Rostrum, one could only marvel at the extraordinary journey traveled by this major Party, a journey of Chinese Communists leading the Chinese people, in their hundreds of millions, in an unyielding struggle against all obstacles and challenges, and scoring spectacular, epoch-making achievements over the past century. To accomplish our great mission, we must always remain true to our original aspiration. Only through vigorous and determined endeavor can we fulfill our responsibility to history, prove worthy of our times and live up to people's expectations.The sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee has adopted the Party's third resolution on historical issues. The CPC's 100-year achievements provide a source of motivation and its 100-year experience a wellspring of inspiration. I have referred to Chairman Mao's conversation with Mr. Huang Yanpei at his cave-dwelling in Yan'an, and the importance of carrying out bold self-revolution so as to gain the historical initiative. To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no easy task like a walk in the park; it will not happen overnight, or through sheer fanfare. We must always keep a long-term perspective, remain mindful of potential risks, maintain strategic focus and determination, and "attain to the broad and great while addressing the delicate and minute".Our country, big as it is, also has its list of priorities. The myriad of things we attend to all boil down to matters concerning every household. Through my field trips to different places, I have seen and heard a lot of things which I find very inspiring and rewarding. Every time I visit people in their homes, I would ask if they have any more difficulties, and I would remember everything my folks have to share with me.The concerns of the people are what I always care about, and the aspirations of the people are what I always strive for. Having worked in the countryside myself, I know precisely what poverty feels like. Thanks to the sustained efforts of the Chinese people from generation to generation, those who once lived in poverty no longer have to worry about food or clothing, or access to education, housing and medical insurance. Realization of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and elimination of extreme poverty is what the CPC has delivered to our people, and it is also a contribution to the world. To ensure that everyone leads a better life, we must never rest on what we have achieved, and there is still a long way to go.A Yellow River well harnessed is a millennia-long aspiration of the Chinese people. Over the past few years, I have visited all nine provinces or autonomous regions on the upper, middle and lower streams of the Yellow River. From the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, two "mother rivers" of the Chinese nation, to the limpid Qinghai Lake and the mighty Yarlung Zangbo River; from the South-North Water Diversion, known as a project of the century, to the Saihanba forest, shown as a patch of green on the map; from the northward trek and homecoming of elephants in Yunnan Province, to the migration and return of Tibetan antelopes -- all these remind us that "If we do not fail Nature, Nature shall never fail us".This year has also recorded many memorable Chinese voices, Chinese moments and Chinese stories: youthful vows of "pledging to the Party to make my country strong"; affectionate expression of "pure, true love saved for the motherland"; the Zhurong rover probing Mars, the Xihe satellite chasing the sun, and the Tianhe space station core module traveling among the stars; athletes outdoing themselves to excel on the sports field; the whole nation staying united in solid COVID-19 response; people in disaster-stricken areas standing together to rebuild their homes; members of the People's Liberation Army and Armed Police devoted to building a strong military and protecting our country. The hard work and dedication of countless unsung heroes have all added to the great momentum of China's march forward in the new era.The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao is always close to the heart of the motherland. Only with unity and concerted efforts can we ensure sound implementation of One Country, Two Systems in the long run. The complete reunification of our motherland is an aspiration shared by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. I sincerely hope that all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation will join forces to create a brighter future for our nation.In my phone calls and virtual meetings with foreign leaders and heads of international organizations, I have heard many times plaudits for China's fight against COVID-19 and contribution to the global COVID response. To date, China has provided two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Only through unity, solidarity and cooperation can countries around the world write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind.In just over a month, the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will open. Greater public involvement in winter sports also contributes to the Olympic Movement. We will spare no effort to present a great Games to the world. The world is turning its eyes to China, and China is ready.The bell is about to ring for the New Year. As we speak, three Chinese astronauts are on duty in outer space; our fellow compatriots overseas are still working very hard; our people posted to diplomatic missions and businesses abroad as well as overseas Chinese students are bravely holding on; and our numerous dream-chasers are keeping up their good work. I salute all your great efforts, and extend to you best wishes for the New Year.Let us all work together for a shared future. May our country enjoy prosperity and our people live in peace and harmony! 
                

                The following is a transcript of an interview given by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Xinhua News Agency and China Media Group on the international situation and China’s diplomacy in 2021 on December 30.Question: In 2021, the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrated its centenary, and China completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieved its first centenary goal. China’s head-of-state “cloud diplomacy” was also very frequent. What is your overall assessment of China’s diplomacy in 2021?Wang Yi: The year 2021 will go down in history as an important year for both the world and China.Across the world, the evolution of unprecedented changes picked up speed due to the pandemic unseen in a century. We witnessed the U.S. Capitol riot, the Kabul Moment, vaccine nationalism, resurgence of the Cold War mentality, and many other turmoils. The world is entering a period of turbulence and transformation at a faster pace.In China, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we have completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, solemnly celebrated CPC’s centenary, and proudly embarked on a new journey toward the second centenary goal. On the diplomatic front, we drew strength from the 100 years of CPC’s achievements, forged ahead through competitions and challenges with courage and grit, writing a new chapter of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.  First, head-of-state diplomacy has played the guiding role on China’s diplomatic front. President Xi Jinping had 79 telephone calls with leaders of foreign countries and international organizations, and attended 40 major diplomatic events via video link. He has stepped up strategic communication with foreign leaders to build consensus and promote cooperation across the globe, thus drawing up the grand blueprint and forming strong synergy for building a community with a shared future for mankind. Head-of-state diplomacy has effectively promoted the overall stability of the relations among major countries, deepened friendship between China and its neighbors, and enhanced the mutually beneficial cooperation with developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. It has enabled China to build a more comprehensive and solid global partnership network. Second, anti-COVID diplomacy has attested to China’s strong sense of international responsibility. We have always been among the first to promote global cooperation against the pandemic, always advocated the number-one feature of vaccines to be global public goods, and always stood at the forefront for the equitable distribution of vaccines. We were among the first to commit to making COVID vaccines a global public good, to support waiving intellectual property rights on vaccine research and development, and to start joint production with other developing countries. We were also among the first to conduct global origins-tracing cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), to reject politicization and stigmatization, and to call for fighting not only the coronavirus but also the political virus. With firm commitments and real actions, China has helped keep the international COVID response in the right direction, and vigorously promoted the building of a global community of health for all.Third, China’s development-oriented diplomacy has contributed a lot to this global cause. On many occasions including the Boao Forum for Asia, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the China International Import Expo, President Xi Jinping announced a string of new measures, such as a shorter negative list, a more business-friendly environment and greater institutional opening-up, to open wider to the world. This has provided opportunities and made contributions to global economic recovery. In response to the grave challenges of COVID-19 to other developing countries, President Xi Jinping put forth the Global Development Initiative (GDI), with a view to building global synergy on accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so that no country or individual will be left behind. As of today, the GDI has received positive response and support from the UN system and nearly 100 countries.Fourth, we have defended justice in multilateral diplomacy. We have held high the banner of multilateralism, championed the common values of humanity, and upheld the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law. We have taken an active part in shaping global governance system on climate, the environment, health and digital development. We have expounded on the building of a community of life for man and nature, and a community of all life on Earth, offering China’s solutions and vitality to the reform of the global governance system.Fifth,we have lived up to our solemn commitment of diplomacy for the people. We have worked actively to support the building of a new development paradigm, and to facilitate the opening of “fast tracks” for essential personnel exchanges and “green lanes” for the shipment of emergency supplies, so as to prevent the spread of the virus from abroad and secure the gains in epidemic control at home. We have adhered to a people-centered approach, built a system on the protection of the interests of people overseas and on risk alert and prevention, and successfully rescued dozens of Chinese hostages. We have timely carried out the Spring Sprout program by vaccinating millions of Chinese compatriots living in 180-plus countries. “Wherever you go, your home country is always your strong backing.” -- This is the enduring mission and commitment of China’s diplomacy.Question: The sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee this year has become a focus of international discussion. How do you think the Plenum will guide China’s diplomacy? How does the international community view CPC’s centenary?   Wang Yi: The sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee comprehensively reviewed the major achievements of the Party over the past century and summarized the Party’s historical experience in ten aspects. Each and every one of them offers important guidance for our work on the diplomatic front.Upholding the Party’s leadership is the fundamental guidance for China’s diplomacy. In the world today, China’s good governance has gained more and more understanding and recognition. The fundamental reason lies in the Party’s centralized, unified leadership. The leadership of the CPC is the greatest political strength of China’s diplomacy. It is the root of the major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and the institutional guarantee for all our achievements.Putting the people first is the source of strength of China’s diplomacy. Only when we ground diplomatic efforts in serving the people, can we truly stand all tests and forge ahead. We in the diplomatic service will always put the people front and center. We will defend the interests of the Chinese people and actively follow the principle of people-centered diplomacy. And we will deepen friendship and cooperation with people from other countries to promote greater solidarity of people around the world.Maintaining a global vision is the original aspiration of China’s diplomacy. While pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the CPC is also committed to promoting human progress and world harmony. This has been the aspiration and mission of the Party since the day of its founding. Keeping in mind both the domestic and international imperatives, we in the diplomatic service will continue to work with other countries to foster a community with a shared future for mankind.   Staying independent is a fine tradition of China’s diplomacy. No matter how the international situation evolves, we will firmly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, and keep to the path of peaceful development. Meanwhile, we will firmly support all countries, especially developing countries, in defending their sovereignty and independence, and exploring the development path suited to their own national conditions.Standing up for ourselves is a distinctive character of China’s diplomacy. China’s diplomacy has grown stronger in the fight against invasion, blockade, sanction and intervention. It represents the unyielding and tenacious spirit of the Chinese nation, and keeps a fine tradition of safeguarding national interests and upholding fairness and justice. On the new journey toward national rejuvenation, we will continue to firmly oppose all hegemonic and bullying practices and proactively undertake our international responsibility for world peace and development.This year marks the centenary of the CPC. We have received messages of congratulations from over 600 political parties and organizations of more than 170 countries. In my engagement with other foreign ministers and senior officials, the first thing they said was usually to congratulate on the centenary of the CPC. In our interactions with the world, we can clearly feel that the international community is paying more attention to the CPC, putting more focus on the CPC, and giving more recognition to the CPC. We in the diplomatic service have also made active efforts to present, defend and promote the correct narratives about the CPC in the world. For example, we launched a program called 100 Stories in CPC’s External Exchanges, which has been read, played and displayed for more than one billion times at home and abroad. We invited diplomats from foreign embassies and representatives of mainstream global media to Yan’an, Jiaxing and other historic sites of the CPC, the Xiangshan Revolution Memorial, and the Museum of the Communist Party of China. These visits have helped foreign friends learn about the centennial history of this major Party and decipher its genetic code. Many foreigners, including some westerners who were once biased, said that the visits gave them a brand new understanding of China and the CPC. They wholeheartedly admire the great achievements by the Chinese people under the leadership of the CPC and wish to know more about the recipe for the success of the Party. Going forward, we will continue to present to the world the true, multidimensional and all-round image of China, and seek more and deeper understanding from the international community for China’s system, China’s path, and China’s vision.Question: The United States and a few other countries are seeking to spread Western values and stoke ideology-driven divisions. This year, we have seen lots of encounters between various different forces in the multilateral arena. What is your take on this?Wang Yi: Some elements in the world still deem themselves superior, and always want to impose their own will on others. They throw out arbitrary rules, and use human rights, democracy and other high-sounding excuses to smear and contain China and many other developing countries. We must not compromise or back down. Instead, we must face them head on, and pull together with most countries to defend fairness and justice and do the right thing for humanity.The first encounter was between true and false multilateralism. Certain countries, while chanting slogans about multilateralism in rhetoric, are building exclusive blocs in action. They are attempting to throw the world back into Cold War confrontation. In response, China has pointed out unequivocally that countries need to uphold and practice true multilateralism. We have stressed that there is but one international system in the world, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. Countries need to resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the UN, jointly oppose division and confrontation, stand together against zero-sum games, and make constant efforts for greater democracy in international relations. This position has been recognized and supported by most countries in the world.The second was the encounter between true and false rules. A small number of countries talk about a so-called “rules-based order”. But they refuse to accept that rules should be based on commonly recognized international law. What they actually want is to impose the “gang rules” by them and their allies on all other countries. In response, China has spoken up repeatedly at the UN and on other multilateral occasions that there is but one set of rules in the world, i.e. the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the UN Charter. This strong message laid bare certain countries’ intention to practice hegemony under the pretext of rules. It has contributed to the stability of the international order.  The third was the encounter between true and false human rights. The US and a few other countries, despite all their own human rights problems,  have long sought to use human rights as a tool to meddle with other countries’ internal affairs, and attack and smear China and other developing countries with groundless accusations. In response, China has stepped forward to set the record straight, articulating China’s outlook on human rights and presenting our accomplishments in human rights development. Meanwhile, we have resolutely pushed back false accusations and let the world see the hypocrisy of the self-styled “champions of human rights”. Justice lies in the heart of people: at the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly, we have thwarted, with overwhelming support from other countries, anti-China motions four times in a row this year. Nearly 100 countries expressed their support for China’s just stance at the UN and their strong opposition to interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.The fourth was the encounter between true and false democracy. The US has staged a so-called “Summit for Democracy”, and fabricated the false narrative of “democracy versus authoritarianism”. In response, China has staunchly upheld the common values of humanity, released a report, The State of Democracy in the United States, and encouraged inclusive discussions about standards and practices of democracy on bilateral and multilateral occasions. Our efforts have laid bare the self-contradictions and shortages of the US democracy, and the US intention has been widely questioned by the international community. The so-called “Summit for Democracy” ended hastily with no consensus, no outcome and no future. This has once again proved that democracy is a common value of humanity, on which no country is entitled to lecture others. Ultimately, it is up to the people of a country to say whether or not their democracy is true and effective.Question: COVID-19 is still ravaging the world. What is China’s contribution to global solidarity in fighting the pandemic, to international science-based origins-tracing and to faster global economic recovery?Wang Yi: Since COVID-19 hit, the whole of China has united as one and launched a science-based response, setting a good example of COVID containment for the international community. While bringing the virus under control domestically, China has, from the very beginning, been committed to helping others affected by the virus. We took the initiative to engage in international cooperation against COVID and made contribution to global public health security.China started with global emergency humanitarian assistance, kicking off the first half of the international campaign against the coronavirus with a focus on providing emergency supplies. Up until now, China has provided about 372 billion masks, over 4.2 billion protective suits and over 8.4 billion testing kits to the international community. Early this year, we began focusing on vaccine cooperation as the international campaign against the virus entered its second half. I wish to take this opportunity to announce that as of 26 December, China has provided more than 2 billion doses of COVID vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations. China has fulfilled the pledge and commitment made by President Xi Jinping to the rest of the world and has become the biggest provider of outbound vaccines among all countries. One out of every two COVID vaccines administered across the globe is made in China. For many countries, especially developing countries, the first batch of vaccines and the majority of the vaccines they have received came from China. This sets China apart from certain countries which only make empty promises.Not long ago, President Xi Jinping announced that China will provide another 1 billion doses of COVID vaccines to Africa, including 600 million doses as a donation, to help African countries achieve the goal set by the African Union of vaccinating 60 percent of the African population by 2022. China will also donate additional 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. We support Chinese companies in transferring technologies to developing countries, and have launched joint vaccine production with 20 countries. All in all, China did not do any of this for selfish geopolitical interest, and China did not attach any political strings to these actions at all. Rather, we are taking concrete actions to help build a great wall of immunization for the health of all and a health shield for developing countries.  Question: This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Good-neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between China and Russia. What does it mean for global strategic stability and development when China and Russia shoulder and carry out their responsibilities? How do you see the current China-Russia relations?Wang Yi: China and Russia are both major countries with global influence. Their strategic coordination and practical cooperation has a global significance and plays an irreplaceable role.This year, the two countries solemnly commemorated the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Good-neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between China and Russia. President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin officially announced the renewal of the Treaty and made it more relevant in the new era. The two Presidents have stayed in close strategic communication throughout the year, and will get together for the Winter Olympics in a little over a month. Guided by the two Presidents, China-Russia relations have become more mature, stable, resilient and vibrant.On pandemic response, China and Russia have served as a good example for the world. With solidarity and mutual assistance, the two countries have been pioneering in vaccine research, development, production and global distribution, and jointly opposed the stigmatization and politicization of issues related to the coronavirus and its origins-tracing, showing other members of the international community that solidarity is the right way to fight the pandemic.On global economic recovery, China and Russia have provided a strong impetus. Their all-dimensional cooperation was greatly elevated to higher levels. Bilateral trade has registered a new record. Major strategic projects are well underway, and cooperation on scientific and technological innovation is advancing rapidly. This has not only improved the well-being of the two countries and peoples, but also created new opportunities for world economic recovery.On regional stability, China and Russia have provided a solid safeguard. The two countries have maintained high-level strategic coordination, promoted a constructive role of the SCO and BRICS, and strengthened strategic coordination on hotspot issues. These efforts are the core pillar for regional stability and solidarity among developing countries.On global governance, China and Russia have demonstrated our sense of responsibility. The two countries firmly upheld the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law. We jointly opposed interference in other countries’ internal affairs, unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. Our efforts have helped build a bulwark supporting the practice of true multilateralism and upholding international equity and justice, showing the world how major countries should behave.We are convinced that as long as China and Russia, as two major countries, stand together shoulder to shoulder and deepen coordination hand in hand, the international order will not fall into disarray, justice in the world will not collapse, and hegemonism will not win.Question: Over the course of this year, the Chinese and US presidents have held two phone conversations and one virtual meeting. Senior officials of the two countries have held several meetings and talks. Yet in the meantime, the US side continues to make negative moves on China. What is your assessment of the current state of China-US relations? How can the two countries find the right way to get along with each other?Wang Yi: The relationship between China and the US has indeed seen some changes this year compared with what happened in the past few years. Since China is determined to defend its rights and reject hegemonism, the US side has come to realize that China will by no means make any concession under the threat of maximum pressure, and that such practices will ultimately hurt US interests.We have seen statements from the US leader and some senior officials that the US does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of its alliances is not anti-China, it does not support “Taiwan independence”, and that it has no intention to have a conflict or confrontation with China.In the meantime, as we have seen, the US continues to stir up trouble on issues concerning China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, causing harm and damage to bilateral relations. This is a typical case of saying one thing yet doing another. This has left US credibility in serious doubt.   The US often claims itself to be a society built on trust. According to ancient Chinese wisdom, a person without credibility could hardly establish himself in society. And this is even more so for relations between countries. If the US side hopes to preserve a level of credibility for itself in the world, it should match its commitments with real, concrete actions to earn trust from the Chinese people and from the international community.As for China’s US policy, our attitude is clear and consistent. President Xi Jinping has solemnly put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. These three principles sum up the experience and lessons of the half-century-long interactions between the two countries. They represent the right way forward for restoring sound and stable growth to China-US relations. Whether that can become a reality depends on whether the US side can truly and thoroughly understand three things:First, China’s development and revitalization is a legitimate right of a sovereign country and, more importantly, an inevitable trend that cannot be changed or stopped by anyone. It would therefore be better to keep abreast with this general trend rather than to go against it. As long as the US gives up its obsession with suppressing and containing China, relations between the two countries could return to the right track and develop steadily.Second, no matter how developed China becomes, it will never take the old path of some Western countries to seek global hegemony, and it has no desire to change, replace or threaten others. As long as the US sees China as a partner instead of an adversary or enemy, the two countries could benefit each other and prosper together.Third, China’s social system and development path represent the determined option and the collective will of the 1.4 billion Chinese people. We respect America’s system and path, but we will never allow any attempts to smear or sabotage the system and path that we have chosen. As long as the US gives up its obsession with ideological confrontation, the two systems and paths adopted by China and the US could work in parallel and coexist peacefully on this planet.Question: The EU has stated on multiple occasions that China is both a partner and a systemic rival. The ratification of the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment was stalled due to some internal issues on the EU side. Where do you think China-EU relations is heading? What will China do to help remove the obstacles to the investment deal?Wang Yi: This year, new progress has been made in many areas in the relations between China and Europe. President Xi Jinping has chaired two video summits with French and German leaders. The China-CEEC Summit has been held successfully via video link. Premier Li Keqiang also engaged extensively with European leaders and business community. Economic and trade cooperation between the two sides has enjoyed positive growth despite overall difficulties, with trade volume for the whole year expected to increase by 30 percent from last year to exceed US$800 billion. The China-EU agreement on geographical indications has come into force. High-level dialogues on the environment and climate and in the digital field have been officially launched. The number of freight services of the China-Europe Railway Express recorded a new high. New progress has been made in flagship Belt and Road projects such as the Piraeus Port and the Budapest-Belgrade Railway. The two sides share extensive consensus on such issues as upholding multilateralism and enhancing global governance, and have achieved positive outcomes in tackling climate change and jointly responding to COVID-19.That said, we have also noticed that Europe’s policy towards China seems to suffer from “cognitive dissonance”. It is hard to imagine that on one hand, Europe seeks to build a comprehensive strategic partnership with China, and on the other hand, it defines China as a systemic rival. This logic has not only undermined China-Europe relations but also brought confusion to European friends themselves. Difference in systems does not mean China and Europe have to be rivals. The two sides could well respect each other, learn from each other, and complement each other. In this context, we stand ready to have closer engagement and communication and earnestly enhance mutual understanding between China and Europe, including open, candid dialogue on such topics as human rights and democracy. Moreover, we hope that Europe, as an important force in the process toward greater multipolarity, will shape an independent, objective and rational perception of China at an early date, and promote and deepen its mutually beneficial cooperation with China following the principle of strategic autonomy. If China and Europe, as two major forces, big markets and great civilizations, can draw on each other’s strengths and forge synergy on the basis of mutual respect, this will augur well for the world and humanity.On the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, it is an economic and trade agreement with the highest level of opening-up and lowest market access threshold to date for China. It is good for China, and even better for Europe. Obstacles to the agreement are obstacles to one’s own development, and will hurt the long-term interests of the European people.Question: In November this year, President Xi Jinping chaired the Special Summit to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of China-ASEAN Dialogue Relations via video link. He and leaders of ASEAN countries announced the upgrade of China-ASEAN relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. How do you evaluate the development of China’s neighborhood diplomacy this year?Wang Yi: This year has been a year of progress and harvest for China and other Asian countries. China has strengthened and upgraded its relations with ASEAN. The two sides have stood together in fighting COVID-19. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has been signed and will soon enter into force. China and ASEAN have stepped up cooperation in the digital economy, blue economy and green economy. Connectivity has been accelerated across the board, and the China-Laos Railway has successfully started operation. The South China Sea issue has been effectively managed under the framework of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and the freedom of navigation and overflight has been protected in accordance with law. On hotspot issues such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, China has stayed in close coordination with countries in the region to jointly safeguard stability in this part of the world.Asia has remained a region with the greatest vitality and development potential in the world. This has not come by easily. It is the result of years of hard work in solidarity by China and regional countries, and it deserves to be cherished by all. Meanwhile, we also see new challenges in this region. There are two divergent trends: one is to jointly pursue development and prosperity through mutual trust and cooperation; the other is to create division and confrontation through “erecting walls” and “decoupling”. It is important that Asian countries remain clear-eyed, stand firm in their positions, and make the right choice that serves their fundamental and long-term interests. We must not allow any country outside this region to stoke bloc confrontation in the region and push Asia toward a new cold war; we must not allow any country outside this region to undermine existing regional cooperation structure and the regional integration process and replace them with one of their own design; we must not allow any country outside this region to provoke an arms race in the region or even proliferation of nuclear weapons and threaten security and stability in Asia.Question: The Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was successfully held in November. President Xi Jinping called for building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era. What measures will China take to further develop its relations with Africa and other members of the developing world?Wang Yi: This year marks the 65th anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations between China and African countries. Not long ago, we successfully held the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the FOCAC despite the impact of COVID-19. President Xi Jinping put forward the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation for the first time, set out four proposals for building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, and announced nine programs for cooperation with Africa. All this marked a new milestone in the history of China-Africa relations.Meanwhile, China’s relations with other members of the developing world, including Latin American and Caribbean countries, Arab countries and Pacific island countries, have made important headway over the year, with fruitful results made in various areas of cooperation.China is a staunch member of the developing world. No matter how the international situation may evolve, China will unswervingly stand on the side of the developing world and unswervingly deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with other developing countries. China’s vote at the United Nations belongs to the developing world. Looking ahead, we will focus on the following priorities:First, upholding the principle of mutual assistance to jointly develop a shield for immunity. China will continue to make all-out efforts to provide developing countries in need with COVID vaccines and essential supplies to ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries and help boost their capacity, confidence and resolve to fight the virus.Second, upholding the principle of mutual benefit to jointly develop an engine for development. We will continue to follow the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests, advance strategic coordination with other developing countries, increase trade and investment, and expand practical cooperation to support other countries in enhancing capacity for sustainable and self-generated development.Third, upholding the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith to joint build a bridge for friendship. We will strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with other developing countries in the fields of political parties and political affairs, poverty reduction and development, and medical and health services, deepen friendship among the peoples, jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the developing countries, and pass on the spirit of friendship and cooperation from generation to generation.Question: The hasty withdrawal of the US forces this year has drawn global attention to the Afghan situation. What role has China played in resolving the Afghanistan issue and other hotspot issues?Wang Yi: In 2021, the entire world witnessed the Kabul Moment, when the US forces left Afghanistan in a rush. Such irresponsible withdrawal has brought a serious humanitarian crisis to the Afghan people and enormous security challenges to regional stability. The scenes of chaos and even shocking brutality at Kabul airport will stay in the memory of humanity forever as a historic mark on the failure of the so-called “democratic transformation”.Facing the sudden changes in Afghanistan, China did not sit by, but extended a helping hand. We immediately reached out to the Afghan people with emergency humanitarian assistance, especially vaccines, food and winterization supplies. The Afghan people have suffered from years of war and turmoil, and should not have to endure the ravages of the pandemic, hunger and cold any more. China has actively facilitated international coordination and played a constructive role in a stable transition of the Afghanistan situation. These efforts have been welcomed and praised by people across Afghanistan. As we speak, Afghanistan still faces serious challenges in economy, people’s livelihoods, security and governance. China will continue to pursue the policy of friendship toward all Afghan people. We support Afghanistan in building an inclusive government, ending turbulence, restoring stability and rebuilding the country, so that the Afghan people will be able to enjoy the benefits of peace and tranquility.I want to stress that major countries shoulder special and important responsibilities for world peace and stability. In handling hotspot issues, major countries should uphold justice, not seek selfish interests; promote peace, not abuse the use of force; encourage dialogue, not resort to willful sanctions; and respect the views of the countries concerned, not throw their weight around. Over the past year, China has kept firmly in mind and fulfilled its responsibility and mission. We have proposed a five-point initiative on promoting peace and stability in the Middle East, with a view to encouraging countries in the region to escape geopolitical rivalry between big powers and achieve self-strengthening through unity. We have put forward a three-point proposal for the implementation of the two-state solution to facilitate a just settlement of the Palestinian question and effective governance in the State of Palestine. We have introduced a four-point proposal for the settlement of the Syrian issue, and supported Syria in accelerating reconciliation and reconstruction as well as returning to the Arab family. We have facilitated the resumption of compliance with the JCPOA to safeguard the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. We have promoted dialogue among relevant parties in Myanmar to encourage a relaunch of democratic transition. We remain committed to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and have worked for synchronized progress in the establishment of a permanent peace mechanism and the denuclearization of the Peninsula.What has happened proves that China’s growing strength increases the force for peace and the rise in China’s influence contributes more constructive factors. China will continue working with the rest of the world, play its due role and make greater contribution to international and regional peace.Question: President Xi Jinping put forth a Global Development Initiative (GDI) for the first time during the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, which received extensive attention from the international community. What is the relationship between the GDI and the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind? How will China implement the GDI?Wang Yi: Development is at the top of governance agenda and the permanent theme of human society. Without development, nothing would be possible. The GDI is an international public good from China. It is an important effort to implement the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. And it demonstrates President Xi Jinping’s global vision and people-centered philosophy. The most central concept of the GDI is to put the people front and center. Its most important goal is to overcome the challenges brought by the pandemic and accelerate the implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its most fundamental pursuit is to meet the aspirations of people around the world for a better life and realize the common values of humanity. In just over three months since it was proposed, the GDI has won the endorsement and support of multiple international organizations including the UN agencies and nearly 100 countries.China not only has put forward the GDI, but will also take action to deliver on this major initiative. Through the platform of the UN and multilateral and bilateral channels, we will further synergize development cooperation strategies with other parties and promote collaboration between the development processes of various countries, regions and mechanisms. We will deepen practical cooperation in the eight priority areas of the GDI to generate strong synergy for attaining the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals on schedule. We will actively deliver our commitment to provide an additional three billion US dollars of international assistance in the next three years, and earnestly support other developing countries in fighting COVID and restoring economic and social development. And we will work with all parties to build a global community of development with a shared future.Question: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of New China in the United Nations. How do you assess China’s role on the international stage in the past 50 years? Why is the practice of multilateralism being highlighted in the current circumstances?Wang Yi: Fifty years ago, the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China was restored in the United Nations. It was a victory that belongs not only to the Chinese people, but also to all the forces for peace and justice in the world.Fifty years on, as the world’s largest developing country and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is playing an increasingly important role in safeguarding world peace and making more and more contributions to human progress.We have followed a path of peaceful development. China has never waged a single war, and is always committed to political settlement of hotspot issues. China has contributed more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the Security Council, and has become the second largest financial contributor to both the United Nations and UN peacekeeping operations.We have upheld international fairness and justice. China has defended the basic norms of international relations based on the UN Charter, upheld the rights of people from different countries to choose their development paths and political systems according to their respective national conditions, and never hesitated to speak up for other developing countries.We have implemented a win-win strategy of opening-up. Twenty years after joining the World Trade Organization, China has done more than its commitments on tariff reduction and market access. It has contributed around 30 percent to global growth for many years.We have actively participated in international affairs. China has been deepening cooperation with the United Nations. To date, it has joined almost all intergovernmental organizations and over 600 international conventions. We have earned the world’s recognition and respect with real action, and the Chinese nation now stands proud in the family of nations.Five decades on, multilateralism is faced with severe challenges. Certain countries, using multilateralism as a cover, are actually taking unilateral moves. Members of the international community need to jointly call out false multilateralism in various forms, unequivocally uphold the international order underpinned by international law, and make unswerving efforts to promote greater democracy in international relations.Question: The Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be held soon. The US and a handful of other countries have said that they would not send officials to the Games. What is your take?Wang Yi: The Olympic spirit is about friendship, mutual understanding, solidarity and fair play. The politicization of the Olympics by certain countries completely violates and discredits the Olympic spirit. At the recent 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, a resolution on Olympic Truce for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games was adopted by consensus. This document, co-sponsored by 173 Member States, speaks volumes about the collective commitment of the international community to the Olympic spirit and their strong support for the Beijing Winter Olympics. Athletes of all nationalities are the real stars on the Olympic stage, cheered on by hundreds of millions of sports fans around the world. The political maneuvering of a few Western politicians will do no harm to a splendid Olympic Games, but only expose their ugly intention.Following a green, inclusive, open and clean approach, China will ensure high-standard, high-quality preparation for the Winter Olympics, and present to people of all countries a streamlined, safe and splendid Games. We believe that whatever interference there may be, the Beijing Winter Olympics will promote the Olympic spirit, help enhance understanding and friendship between people of different countries, demonstrate the strength of international solidarity and cooperation, and bring more confidence and courage to a world still under the shadow of a pandemic.Question: This year, China resumed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and downgraded relations with Lithuania to the level of chargé d’affaires, which showed China’s firm will to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. What is your view of the prospects of diplomatic contests regarding Taiwan?Wang Yi: Recently, Nicaragua resumed diplomatic relations with China and returned to the right track of the one-China principle. China has gained a new friend in the world. This fully proves that the one-China principle is a universally recognized principle and represents people’s aspiration and the trend of the world. On the Taiwan question, let me also emphasize the following:There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of China. This is an undeniable historical and legal fact. Though there is political antagonism between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as a result of the civil war fought many years ago, China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity has never been severed and will not be severed. This is the true status quo of the Taiwan question and also the essence of the 1992 Consensus reflecting the one-China principle, and therefore forms the foundation for pursuing peaceful development of cross-Strait ties. The DPP authorities, however, have been bent on undermining this status quo and foundation. They are the ones responsible for current tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The US has gone back on its commitment made when it established diplomatic relations with China, condoned and abetted “Taiwan independence” forces, and tried to distort and hollow out the one-China principle. This will put Taiwan into an extremely precarious situation and bring an unbearable cost to the US itself.The reunification of China is an unstoppable trend. Attempts to seek “Taiwan independence” will inevitably end up in failure. There is no other way out for Taiwan than to reunify with the mainland. This is an inexorable trend of history and the only practical and logical outcome.Question: In 2022, the CPC will convene its 20th National Congress. As China embarks on a new journey toward meeting its Second Centenary Goal, how will China’s diplomacy serve domestic development? What are China’s diplomatic priorities in 2022?Wang Yi: In 2022, we in the diplomatic service will rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and we will fulfill our duty to the Party, help resolve our country’s concerns and dedicate ourselves to the well-being of the people. We will focus on eight priorities:First, we will make every effort to create a favorable external environment for the CPC’s 20th National Congress. The 20th CPC National Congress is the biggest priority and the most important political event for the Party and the country in the coming year. We will firmly guard against and address all sorts of external risks and challenges and actively tell the stories of the CPC and the Chinese people, so as to foster a secure and stable external environment for the success of the 20th CPC National Congress. This will be the main focus of our diplomatic work throughout 2022.Second, we will make solid efforts for the success of the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. Beijing is heading into the Olympic cycle. We will uphold the Olympic spirit, foster a positive, amicable and harmonious international atmosphere for the Games, and present a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games to the world.Third, we will actively shape the course of reform of the global governance system. In the next year, Asian countries will host a series of multilateral events. China will take over as the chair of BRICS and host the BRICS summit. The APEC economic leaders’ meeting and the summits of G20 and SCO will also be held in Asian countries. “Asia’s time” will come in global governance. We will take an active part, suggest ideas for the way forward, continue to hold high the banner of true multilateralism, and contribute more Chinese wisdom and Asian energy to the reform and improvement of the global governance system.Fourth, we will take proactive steps to tackle the many challenges in the post-COVID era. We will fully implement the Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative, actively carry out cooperation on COVID drug research and development, uphold international solidarity, and foster international synergy to enhance preparedness against future pandemics. We will also strengthen communication and coordination with other countries and the United Nations, enhance support for realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and promote comprehensive implementation of the Global Development Initiative.  Fifth, we will deepen and expand global partnerships. Next year, China will celebrate important anniversaries of its diplomatic relations with a number of countries. We will take them as the opportunity to consolidate traditional friendship and expand cooperation bilaterally, strive to maintain overall steady and balanced growth of China’s relations with other major countries, continue to advance interconnected development with neighboring countries, and offer full support for all developing countries in sharing the benefits of development.Sixth, we will continue to resolutely safeguard China’s core interests. We will faithfully fulfill our duties and responsibilities, and fully live up to the expectations of the Party and the people. We will resolutely and forcefully fight off any attempt to undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development interests. And we will firmly and effectively fight back against any move to undermine the Chinese people’s legitimate rights and interests.Seventh, we will actively serve China’s opening-up and development. We will promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and safeguard the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains. We will take an active part in global climate governance, and lend a stronger impetus to China’s domestic endeavor promoting green and low-carbon transition and development. We will implement well the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and work to advance China’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. We will facilitate free trade arrangements with the Gulf Cooperation Council as soon as possible, speed up China-Japan-ROK free trade negotiations, and explore ways to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation with Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. In so doing, we will contribute to the national effort of boosting domestic and international economic circulations and fostering a new development paradigm.Eighth, we will serve the people wholeheartedly through diplomatic work. We will deepen the reform of consular services, improve the working mechanisms and systems for consular protection, step up legislation concerning consular protection, and accelerate the development of smart consular services and digital consular services. We will speed up efforts to build a system for the protection of Chinese nationals and interests overseas, and take concrete actions to protect the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals and institutions overseas.The year 2022 is the Year of the Tiger in the Chinese lunar calendar. We in China’s diplomatic service will maintain a global vision, forge ahead in confident strides and take concrete actions. We will work in solidarity and collaboration with the international community to bring dynamism to world peace and development with “the vitality of the tiger”, and promote greater progress and “a tiger’s leap” in human development.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Wu JianghaoAssistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China At the Opening Ceremony of the Second International Seminar on CounterterrorismBeijing, 22 December 2021Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,It gives me great pleasure to attend the second International Seminar on Counterterrorism. On behalf of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I wish to give my congratulations on the convening of the seminar, and welcome the representatives, experts and scholars from all countries. I also wish to thank the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations for putting this event together.One year ago at the first seminar, the participants discussed the trend of international counterterrorism cooperation, and explored ways to tackle global counterterrorism challenges. The event helped build consensus and synergy, and demonstrated our shared resolve and commitment. Now, at the end of the year, the participants are once again meeting on the "cloud" to share their insights on the new developments and challenges of counterterrorism and jointly look for solutions, which makes the event most timely and relevant.The year 2021 has witnessed the resurgence of international terrorist activities. The inward-looking counterterrorism strategies of certain countries have weakened the momentum of international cooperation. Some countries are confronted with economic and livelihood challenges and escalating social tensions, which make them vulnerable targets of terrorist forces. A few countries have turned counterterrorism into a political tool, making groundless accusations against the legitimate counterterrorism and deradicalization measures taken by the international community. They have even exploited terrorist forces to advance their own geopolitical interests, which will only fuel the resurgence of terrorism.Two decades of war in Afghanistan has brought tremendous suffering to the Afghan people and also provided the breeding ground for all kinds of terrorist forces. This year, the situation in Afghanistan has drastically changed. Terrorist groups including ISIS, Al-Qaeda and ETIM have been using the chaos in the region to expand their presence and stir up troubles.Out of their own political interests, certain countries have attempted to clean the name of ETIM, a terrorist organization listed by the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council. This active terrorist group not only seriously endangers China's security and stability, but also poses a real threat to the international community. It is hoped that all countries will fully recognize the violent and terrorist nature of ETIM, and work with China to resolutely crack down on the group.The new threats and new challenges in the counterterrorism field call for high vigilance. Emerging technologies are being abused by terrorist forces. The use of cyberspace has made terrorist activities more covert and unchecked, and pushed terrorism closer to organized crimes.In countries with polarized politics, ripped societies, and rising populism and xenophobia, violent attacks targeting people from specific ethnic groups, social classes and religions are increasing. Far-right ideologies such as white supremacy and anti-immigrants are running into conflict with Islamist extremism, leading to a vicious circle of terrorist attacks and hatred. These new threats and new challenges have added to the difficulties of preventing and combating terrorism, and the international community needs to step up efforts to study and manage the new situation.Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,In the face of constant terrorist threats, we need to draw experience and lessons from history, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security, and strengthen global dialogue and cooperation on counterterrorism. We need to pool our efforts, follow a multi-pronged approach, and join hands to address these new threats and new challenges of terrorism.First, we need to foster the awareness of a community with a shared future. There is no safe haven or Shangri-la in the face of terrorism. Solidarity and cooperation is the most powerful weapon to defeat terrorism. Counterterrorism should not become a tool of major-country rivalry or a leverage in geopolitics, still less an excuse to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. We must abandon ideological biases, oppose double standards on counterterrorism and reject linking terrorism with specific countries, ethnicities or religions. We need to support the counterterrorism and deradicalization efforts of all countries and build a global united front against terrorism. The lessons of the boomerang effect are still fresh in memory, and must be learned by heart.Second, we need to underscore the central role played by the UN. Counterterrorism issues are complex and intricate. What is needed is to uphold and practice true multilateralism, and rise above small-circle and zero-sum mentalities. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be truly observed, the central and coordinating role of the UN in global counterterrorism must be fully ensured, and UN Security Council resolutions must be strictly enforced. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy. We need to seize this opportunity to push for full implementation of the strategy, and gather stronger synergy for the global counterterrorism campaign.Third, we need to strengthen capacity building in developing countries. Many developing countries are at the forefront of the battle against terrorism, and bearing the brunt of the terrorist scourge. We need to help developing countries and countries on the counterterrorism front line to further enhance their counterterrorism and deradicalization capability and build robust protection across the line of defense. We need to listen more to the positions and demands of these countries on counterterrorism and formulate a global counterterrorism strategy that is more relevant to the situation on the ground and targeting real problems.Fourth, we need to follow the principle of addressing both symptoms and root causes. Counterterrorism is a complex, challenging and systemic project. Only by eyeing for the long term and addressing the origin of the problem, and with specific steps on the economic, political, social, cultural and religious fronts, can we remove the breeding ground for terrorism and ultimately achieve victory over terrorism. The twenty year-long war in Afghanistan proves once again that military means alone cannot eradicate terrorism, and imposing democracy in the name of counterterrorism simply won't work and cannot be sustained either.Fifth, we need to tackle new terrorist threats and ideologies. We should focus on new challenges such as abuse of the Internet and emerging technologies by terrorists, collusion between terrorism and organized crimes, and diversified forms of terrorist financing, and step up research and analysis of new terrorist ideologies and their immediate impact and dangers. In the meantime, we need to vigorously promote inter-civilization exchanges and dialogue and advocate equality, mutual respect and inclusiveness to remove the ideological causes of conflicts.Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Not long ago, the sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was successfully convened. The plenary was held at the important moment of the centenary of the CPC and the critical conjuncture where China's Two Centenary Goals converge. It is an extremely important meeting with profound and far-reaching significance. The plenary noted that China has constructively participated in political resolution of international and regional hotspots and played a positive role in areas such as countering terrorism and safeguarding regional security. As an important participant and contributor to international counterterrorism, China will continue to work with all parties to promote fruitful exchanges and cooperation on counterterrorism and deradicalization. We will share Chinese wisdom, offer Chinese experience and contribute Chinese resources to upholding international and regional security and stability.Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Counterterrorism is a battle between light and darkness. The purpose of international counterterrorism cooperation is to light the torch, dispel darkness and safeguard peace and tranquility for humanity. Let us work in solidarity, respond to the call of the times, deepen counterterrorism cooperation and ultimately eliminate the major threat of terrorism to humanity. To conclude, I wish this seminar a full success.Thank you!
                

                Address by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Minister of Foreign AffairsAt the Symposium on the International Situation andChina's Foreign Relations in 2021Beijing, 20 December 2021Experts and Friends,Good morning!I am delighted to join you again to take stock of international developments and China’s foreign relations during this year. Let me first take this opportunity to thank you for your longstanding interest in and support for our diplomatic work. I sincerely welcome your input and insights on China’s diplomacy.During the past year, the world has witnessed a persistent and unchecked pandemic, accelerating changes unseen in a century and a period of turbulence and transformation globally. Confronted by unprecedented challenges, countries around the world are looking for answers and humanity are required to make the right choice.Standing at this crossroads, we have observed two opposite trends at play. One is to revert to a Cold War mentality to deepen division and antagonism, and stoke confrontation between blocs. The other is to act by the common well-being of humanity to increase solidarity and cooperation, advocate openness and win-win results, and promote equality and respect. The tug of war between these two trends will shape the future of humanity and our planet in a profound way.China has all along stood on the right side of history, and on the side of human progress, the side of international equity and justice, and the side of the vast developing countries. We have drawn experience and wisdom from the 100-year journey of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and forged ahead in keeping with the general trend, overall dynamics and entire course of history. We have chosen cooperation over confrontation, openness over isolation, mutual benefit over zero-sum game, and equality over power politics and bullying. Together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, we have endeavored to keep the wheels of human development rolling toward a brighter future.For China’s diplomacy, the past year has seen us acting under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core,embracing a global vision and serving the nation and our people. We have opened up new vistas amidst global changes, turned crises into opportunities in a complex world, and steadfastly forged ahead through struggle as well as cooperation. For China’s diplomacy over the past year, the strongest guide of action ishead-of-state diplomacy, the most distinct banner is building a community with a shared future for mankind,the most prominent topic is to tell the world stories of the Chinese people and the CPC, and the most remarkable feature is to adapt to changes properly and keep breaking new ground. Underlying everything we have done, there is one clear theme: to serve national rejuvenation amidst a complex situation and advance peaceful development in a fast-changing world.Great endeavors have been made on the nine fronts:First, facing a once-in-a-century, protracted and resurging pandemic, we have conducted effective anti-COVID diplomacy and fulfilled the responsibility of a major country. With the pandemic already claiming over 5.3 million precious lives, it is imperative for the international community to enhance cooperation against the pandemic. China has set a good example of COVID response through a “dynamic zero-COVID” strategy as well as a good example of solidarity against the pandemic through greater international cooperation. With concrete actions, we have spearheaded the path to emerging from the darkest hour of the pandemic and kept moving forward.We have explored the right direction for global COVID response. From the World Health Assembly to the Global Health Summit, from UN events to bilateral phone calls and virtual meetings, President Xi Jinping has, during the most critical moments, advocated the Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative and the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation. Under President Xi Jinping’s leadership, China has been a pace-setter for strengthening international cooperation, upheld the primary feature of vaccines as a global public good, and been at the forefront of efforts for the equitable distribution of vaccines. This stood in sharp contrast with a certain country’s political manipulation that undermined global solidarity against COVID-19.We have provided powerful tools for defeating the virus. China was among the first to commit to making COVID vaccines a global public good, to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines, and to start joint production with other developing countries. To date, we have provided close to two billion dosesof vaccines to over 120 countries as well as international organizations, accounting for one-third of the total number of vaccines administered outside China. This is more than any other country in the world. While a certain country has hoarded vaccines and practiced “vaccine nationalism”, Chinese vaccines has become “vaccines for the people”, “vaccines of the world” and “vaccines truly accessible”, bringing hope to the global community.We have assisted other developing countries in a time of urgent need. The current “vaccine divide” has been the biggest impediment to ending the pandemic, with only five percent of the population in low-income countries fully vaccinated. Showing great care for other developing countries, President Xi Jinpinghas pledged another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa, including 600 million doses as donation, to support the African Union’s goal of vaccinating 60 percent of the African population. An initiative has been put forward to build a “health shield” for ASEAN countries by donating an additional 150 million doses of vaccines to them. Three billion US dollars has been pledged over the next three years to help fellow developing countries contain the virus and revive the economy. China has also supported Chinese companies in transferring technology to other developing countries and carrying out joint production with 19 countries so that vaccines could literally travel across mountains and oceans and win the race against the virus.We have stood for a collaborative approach to COVID-19 origins-tracing. The coronavirus is the common enemy of mankind, and the “political virus” has been behind the spread of COVID-19. China has taken an active part in the global, science-based efforts to trace the origins of the coronavirus. China and the World Health Organization (WHO) have released a joint report on the origins of the virus, demonstrating a commitment to openness, transparency and international cooperation. The political attacks by a certain country under the camouflage of origins-tracing undermined global solidarity and collaboration against the pandemic, and stimulated the physical spread of the virus. Over 80 countries have written to the WHO to express their opposition to politicization of origins-tracing. More than 25 million Chinese have joined theonline petition calling for the WHO to investigate the Fort Detrick bio-lab. The consensus is becoming global to reject politicization, stigmatization and the use of origins-tracing as an instrument for political maneuvering. In the end, both the coronavirus and the political virus will be defeated by humanity.Second, facing multiple risks to global development, we have injected new impetus into economic recovery and created new opportunities for common development. Development is an unending pursuit of humanity and economic recovery the shared goal of all countries. At the moment, the global recovery remains fragile and tortuous. Inflation, debt, energy and supply chain crises have become intertwined. The gains of poverty reduction have been seriously eroded. The North-South gap has widened. All this has made it a daunting task to fully implement the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Over the past year, we have focused on development as the solution to all problems and made dedicated efforts toward more robust, green and balanced global development. President Xi Jinping has officially put forth a Global Development Initiative aimed at enhancing all people’s well-being and realizing all-round human development. It dovetails with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and prioritizes cooperation on poverty reduction, food security, COVID response and vaccines, development financing, climate change, green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity. We hope to see greater global synergy and support for this Initiative, which will help re-energize efforts for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In launching this major initiative, China endeavors to contribute to the global development cause.  Already, the Global Development Initiative has received endorsement and support from UN agencies and many other international organizations, together withsome 100 countries in the world.Over the past year, we have opened up China’s economy at a higher level and given a strong boost to global economic recovery. This year marks the 20th anniversary of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization. On many occasions including the Boao Forum for Asia, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the China International Fair for Trade in Services and the China International Import Expo (CIIE), President Xi Jinping have announced a string of new measures, such as a shorter negative list, a more business-friendly environment and greater institutional opening-up, to open wider to the world and share China’s development opportunities with other countries. The fourth CIIE in November drew a record number of 127 countries and regions and as many as 3,000 companies, which speaks volumes about the appeal of the massive Chinese market. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will enter into force in just 11 days, marking the official launch of the world’s most promising free trade area serving the largest number of people. China has also applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, thus taking new steps toward openness and cooperation in the face of protectionist headwinds. These are good news for the outlook of the global recovery.The year 2021 also witnessed Belt and Road cooperation making headway despite various difficulties. The third symposium on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has drawn up a new blueprint. In the first ten months of this year, China’s trade in goods with BRI partner countries rose by 23 percent, and China-Europe Railway Express saw accelerated growth in freight services and cargo volume, both bucking the downward trends elsewhere. The China-Laos Railway is officially up and running, fulfilling the long-held dream of the Lao people to turn their land-locked country into a land-linked one. With the support of 144 countries and 32 international organizations, the BRI is fast becoming “a belt of prosperity” benefiting the world and “a road of happiness” benefiting all peoples.Third, facing the contest between true and false multilateralism, we have held high the torch of true multilateralism, and firmly upheld the authority of the UN and a stable international order.This year, we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations (UN). China’s return to the UN was a major event that changed the world and marked a revitalization of multilateralism. For the past 50 years, China has worked relentlessly for the vision of the UN and become a staunch force for promoting world peace and development.At the same time, people have seen the behavior of a certain country bent on building exclusive blocs under the pretext of multilateralism, imposed its own rules on the international community while calling for a “rules-based order”, and drawn ideological lines despite claims of not seeking “a new Cold War”. In response, President Xi Jinping has pointed out unequivocally that in today’s world, there is but one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core; there is but one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law; and there is but one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the UN Charter. On international, regional and bilateral occasions, we have spoken up to shatter the pretenses of false multilateralism and givenvoice to the common aspiration of people around the world. We have promoted efforts to reform and improve global governance in line with the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and made new progress in making international relations more democratic.Regarding a certain country’s interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy and human rights, and the fabrication of false narratives of democracy versus authoritarianism, we have upheld the common values of humanity, setting forth China’s success in practicing whole-process people’s democracy, and highlighting public satisfaction as the ultimate criterion for measuring democracy. We have refuted the false narratives through multilateral forums and bilateral dialogues, safeguarding the true spirit of democracy and a genuinely right understanding of what democracy is about, while revealing the hidden purpose of a self-important, “so-called” superior model of democracy. Throughout this major debate about true and false democracy, it has become the call of more and more countries to oppose monopolizing the definition of democracy or dividing the world along ideological lines.Fourth, facing the profound evolution of the international landscape, we have promoted overall steady growth of China’s relations with other major countries and endeavored to build a new type of international relations.Major countries, which have major influence on international relations and shoulder special responsibility for world peace and stability, are obliged to think in big-picture terms and rise to their responsibilities. China has actively explored and facilitated the building of a framework of major-country relations that features overall stability and balanced development.China and Russia have scaled new heights in theircomprehensive strategic coordination for a new era. The two countries solemnly commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin officially announced the extension of the treaty, a testimony to the firm resolve of the two countries to be each other’s strategic support, development opportunity and global partner. Over the past year, the two presidents have had four meetings or phone calls and maintained close strategic communication. China and Russia have joined efforts in their fight against COVID-19, adding a timely dimension to the traditional friendship between the two nations. Mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas has provided strong support for innovation-driven development in both countries. Sino-Russian strategic coordinationon international and regional hot-spots has brought greater stability to a worldfraught with uncertainties. The joint strength of China and Russia has become the bulwark of international fairness and justice. Guided by the two presidents, the China-Russia relationship has stood all kinds of tests and grown ever more vibrant. It has set a good example for maintaining strategic trust between major countries, for deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between two neighbors, and for building a new type of international relations. The China-Russia partnership has stayed rock-solid. No matter how the international situation may evolve, China and Russia will remain unchanged in their commitment to an ever-lasting friendship, to joint pursuit of win-win cooperation, and to shared resolve to upholding peace.China and the United States have explored a new mode of interactions based on mutual respect and equality. Since the beginning of this year, President Xi Jinping has had two requested telephone conversations with President Joe Biden, and the two presidents also held their first virtual meeting recently. President Xi Jinping gave comprehensive exposition of China’s principled position on China-US relations, and clearly outlined a strategic framework of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation for China-US relations, charting the course for the sound and steady growth of this relationship. Chinese and US diplomats have had in-depth communication and interaction in Anchorage, Tianjin, Zurich and Rome, during which the Chinese side pointed out the crux and core issues of China-US relations, set clear “three bottom lines” and put forward “two lists of key concerns”. It was emphasized that China does not recognize any country as being superior to others in the world, and that the United States should drop its old habit of wanton interference in China’s internal affairs. It was underscored that the United States must never challenge China’s path and system, never obstruct China’s development process, and never infringe on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Through unremitting efforts, Ms. Meng Wanzhou returned safely to China after being illegally held for over 1,000 days, a powerful example of justice prevailing eventually.The US side indicated that it would work with China on the basis of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence to increase communication and manage differences,and that it does not seek to change China’s system,the revitalization of its alliances is not against China, and it has no intention to have a conflict with China.The back and forth between China and the United States over the past year shows once again that the fundamental reason for the serious difficulties and multiple challenges in the relationship lies in the strategic misjudgment by the United States regarding China and China-US relations. Some Americans, deep in their hearts, are reluctant to recognize other countries’ right to development, to accept China’s growing strength and progress, and to acknowledge that the two countries may work together for mutual benefit. They even attempted to gang up with other countries to contain and suppress China. Such wrong words and acts have undermined the interests of the two peoples, and had repercussions on world peace and stability. China’s attitude is consistent and clear-cut: dialogue may be conducted, but it should be based on equality; cooperation is welcome, but it should be for mutual benefit; competition may exist, but it should be healthy in nature; confrontation, which China does not fear, will be met in kind. The two countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. This is the most important experience the two countries have learned through their half-century-long interactions, and will continue to be proved by what will happen in the time ahead. It is hoped that the US side will follow through on the common understandings of the two presidents, honor its commitment, earn trust from others, and work with China to explore a way of peaceful coexistence between the two major countries.China and the European Union have overcome challenges and made new progress in their comprehensive strategic partnership. President Xi Jinping has attended two video summits with French and German leaders. A China-CEEC Summit has been held successfullyvia video link. The China-EU agreement on geographical indications has come into force. Steady progress has been made in flagship Belt and Road projects such as the Piraeus Port and the Budapest-Belgrade Railway. China and the EU are seeing a greater convergence of their economic interests. The two sides share extensive consensus on such issues as upholding multilateralism and enhancing global governance, and have achieved positive outcomes in tackling climate change and jointly responding to COVID-19. Although China and the EU differ in history, culture, social system and development stage, their common interests far outweigh their differences. China has unbending sincerity in growing relations with the EU. In the meantime, China remains firm when it comes to safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests. We hope that the EU will continue to maintain strategic autonomy, steer clear of obstacles, and work with China for long-term and steady progress in China-EU cooperation.Fifth, facing peoples’ call for peace and development, we have joined force with our neighbors to build a beautiful homeland and uphold regional peace and tranquility. Asia is the most vibrant region in the world. To promote regional peace and common development is the shared aspiration of countries in the region. However, to borrow a Chinese saying, “While the tree prefers calm, the wind will not subside.” A certain non-regional power has unveiled an Indo-Pacific strategy to stoke confrontation and create rival blocs in the region, thus causing the greatest impediment to regional peace and stability. China has always followed the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in relation to its neighbors. We will continue to work with neighboring countries to deepen cooperation and pursue tangible progress in bilateral and multilateral ties.We have focused on regional cooperation to cement the foundation of friendship. President Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN countries have jointly cerebrated the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations and announced the elevation of the China-ASEAN relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,marking a big step forward. We were among the first to ratify the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. We have promoted synergy between the BRI and the priority areas of cooperation outlined in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and set up a new architecture for Lancang-Mekong Cooperation in all dimensions. Premier Li Keqiang attended the leaders’ meetings on East Asian cooperation to un cover new potential in cooperation on digital economy, blue economy and green economy. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has, on its 20th anniversary,launched procedures to admit Iran as a member state, and the first offline foreign ministers’meeting between China and five Central Asian countries (C+C5) was held, both being solid steps toward greater unity in the region. In a phone call initiated by the new Japanese Prime Minister, President Xi Jinping and the Japanese Prime Minister reached common understandings on developing a bilateral relationship that answers the call of the new era. They also pointed the way for overcoming impediments to the sound growth of bilateral ties. China and India have maintained dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, and effectively managed and controlled frictions in certain border areas, under a shared commitment to improving and developing the bilateral relations. China’s friendship and cooperation with the DPRK, the ROK, Mongolia and other neighboring countries has also sustained a good momentum, serving as a positive factor in regional stability.We have played a constructive role to actively mediate in hotspot issues. The United States and its allies made a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the regional situation has experienced profound changes. As a friendly neighbor and a responsible major country, China has taken the initiative to exert a positive influence by advocating the launch of the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on the Afghan Issue among the Neighbouring Countries of Afghanistan, a new mechanism that harnesses the strengths and unique role of the neighboring countries. We have provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, opened an air freight corridor for Afghan pine nuts, and helped Afghanistan improve its people’s lives. We have encouraged the new Afghan administration to follow a policy of inclusiveness, counter-terrorism and good-neighborliness and to resolutely fight all terrorist organizations including the East Turkistan Islamic Movement. We have supported Afghanistan in preventing chaos, maintaining stability, fighting terrorism, ending violence, and developing in the right direction. Myanmar is a neighbor that shares a pauk-phaw friendship with China. Despite changes in Myanmar’s domestic politics, China has always supported Myanmar in working with ASEAN, gradually implementing the five-point consensus proposed by ASEAN, and firmly rejecting undue external intervention. We have also conducted mediation to promote talks, helped stabilize and deescalate the situation, and encouraged parties in Myanmar to resolve differences properly through peaceful means and to restart the democratic transition process.Sixth, facing the developing countries’urgent aspiration for revitalization, we have worked vigorously to further develop the potential of South-South cooperation. The developing countries are China’s natural partners and reliable allies. Over the past year, guided by the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests and the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, bearing in mind their need to fight COVID-19 on the one hand and achieve recovery and development on the other, and by providing both immediate, much-needed assistance and expertise for long-term benefits, China has wholeheartedly facilitated the sustainable development of developing countries and unequivocally supported them in defending their legitimate rights and interests.Cooperation between China and Africa has reached a new climax. China and African countries have overcome the impact of COVID-19 and held a successful Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. While attending the conference via video link, President Xi Jinping highlighted the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, spelt out four proposals for building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, and announced nine programs for cooperation with Africa. This is a new milestone in China-Africa relations and a full expression of China’s sincerity in supporting Africa’s development and revitalization. Over the past year, China-Africa trade and investment have both grown despite the headwinds. Efforts have been made to synergize the Global Development Initiative with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union and development strategies of African countries, to set up a platform for China-Africa private investment promotion, and to open “green lanes” for African agricultural exports to China, in a bid to help Africa with faster post-COVID recovery. China and Africa have also jointly launched an Initiative on Partnership for Africa’s Development and formulated a China-Africa Partnership Plan on Digital Innovation, adding new dimensions to China-Africa cooperation.Relations between China and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries have made steady progress. President Xi Jinping had telephone conversations with the heads of state or government of a number of LAC countries, and addressed the Third Ministers’ Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum (CCF) via video link, setting the direction for future development of China-LAC relations. A three-year roadmap for cooperation was formulated at this CCF; high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with LAC countries has been further substantiated; new progress has been made in energy, electricity, transportation, communications and other areas of cooperation; and China-LAC trade has remained above US$300 billion for four consecutive years. The two sides are stepping up efforts to foster a China-LAC relationship for a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness, and benefits for the people.The strategic partnership between China and Arab states has scaled a new height. China has maintained close communication with Arab states at the leaders’ level, and had interactions with the entire Arab world at the foreign-minister level. China has proposed a five-point initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East, a four-point proposal for the political settlement of the Syrian issue, and a three-point vision for the implementation of the two-state solution, contributing positive energy to peace and stability in the Middle East. This year, we have held the first China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, which yielded important outcomes including the setup of a jointemergency supplies reserve, a poverty reduction and development cooperation center, and a climate action cooperation center. The emergency supplies reserve was officially launched early this month.Facts have shown that China is always a staunch member of the developing world. It will keep forging ahead hand in hand with fellow developing countries toward a shared future.Seventh, facingthe common challenges for humanity, we have held high the banner of a community with a shared future for mankind and actively promoted reforms of the global governance system. Under the combined impact of a pandemic and changes both unseen in a century, there has been a growing call for reforms of the global governance system. In response to challenges of our times, President Xi Jinping has offered distinctive Chinese solutions. At various important international fora including the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference, the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly and the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Rome, President Xi Jinping put forwardmajor initiatives on building a global community of health for all, a community of life for man and nature, and a global community of development with a shared future. These proposals have further enriched the vision on a community with a shared future for mankind, and injected vitality to the reform of the global governance system.We have pushed for the improvement of the global health governance system. We have supported strengthening the role of the UN and the WHO, enhanced our capacity in five key areas including on monitoring, early-warning and emergency response, on treatment of major pandemics, on contingency reserve and logistics, on fighting disinformation, and on providing support to developing countries, and played an important role in global health cooperation. We have fulfilled our responsibility for global climate governance, by rolling out a policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality,by making the announcement on not building new coal-fired power projects abroad, by facilitating the agreement on the Glasgow Climate Pact, by releasing a joint declarationwith the United States on enhancing climate action, and by setting up and investing in a Kunming Biodiversity Fund.We are committed to being a promoter of ecological conservation and a doer in global governance.We have also taken an active part in global digital governance, by raising the profile of the Global Initiative on Data Security, by issuing a China-League of Arab States Cooperation Initiative on Data Security, and by applying to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, with a view to promoting a global digital governance system that is fairer and more equitable.Eighth,facing external interference and provocations, we have resolutely defended our national sovereignty, security and dignity. Over the past year, the Chinese foreign service has lived up to the expectations of the people, fulfilled its mission, and rebuffed all sorts of infringements and bullying,demonstrating the self-confidence, self-reliance and perseverance of the Chinese people, and the ambition, determination and integrity of the Chinese nation.With regard to the new round of tensions across the Taiwan Straits, the crux lies in the attempt by the Taiwan authorities to seek American support for independence and the intention of the United States and a very few other countries to use the Taiwan question to contain China. The connotation of the one-China principle is at risk of being obscured or even written off. These perverse moves have changed the status quo, undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and run counter to the international consensus and basic norms governing international relations. In response, we have issued stern warnings and taken forceful countermeasures, deterring the separatist forces for “Taiwan independence”. Ten days ago, China restored diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, raising the number of countries having diplomatic relations with China to 181 and further consolidating the international consensus on one China. Taiwan is a long lost son who will eventually return home. It should not be used as a pawn to serve others’ agenda. The reunification of China must be achieved and will definitelybe achieved.Over the past year, we have also invited people from around the world to Xinjiang, and busted lies and falsehoods with facts. We have resolutely opposed externalinterference in Hong Kong affairs, and sustained the good momentum of Hong Kong returning to law and order. We have fought back moves to stir up trouble at multilateral fora under the pretext of human rights, including at the UN Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. By presenting to the world China’s achievements in human rights advancement, and exposing the poor human rights record of certain countries, we have prevailed over false narratives with indisputable facts, winning the support of nearly 100 countries. We have successfully rallied 173 countries in co-sponsoring and adopting an Olympic Truce resolution, securing strong international support for the Beijing Winter Olympics.Ninth, facing a grave and complex external environment, we have worked all-out to serve domestic development and acted on our commitment of serving the people through diplomacy. Serving domestic development is an inherent goal of China’s diplomacy. This year, the Foreign Ministry has successfully hosted promotion events for Hubei and Tibet, and supported the China International Fair for Trade in Services, the China International Import Expo, and other international events hosted by China, in a bid to build new bridges for different localities to open up wider to the world and unlock new development opportunities for them. To support the building of a new development paradigm and ensure unimpeded domestic and international circulations, we have opened “fast tracks” for the travel of essential personnel and “green lanes” for the shipment of emergency COVID-19 supplies. We have also introduced targeted COVID-19 protocols for incoming travelers prior to their trips to secure the gains in pandemic control at home.The people-centered principle is the defining feature of China’s diplomacy. We have always kept in mind the well-being of Chinese nationals abroad and lived up to our commitment of serving the people through diplomacy. We have launched a Spring Sprout program this year to get Chinese nationals abroad vaccinated against COVID-19, so far benefiting millions in 180 countries. Our consular service hotline 12308, running 24/7 to help Chinese nationals facing difficulties abroad, has received over 500,000 calls this year. Our diplomatic missions abroad have processed about 60,000 consular protection and assistance cases of various kinds. We have done our best to protect the lives and safety of Chinese nationals abroad, including through risk assessment and alert services around the globe, helping Chinese enterprises and personnel operating overseas enhance security and self-protection capabilities, timely evacuation of Chinese from high-risk areas, proper handling of major terrorist attacks, and all-out rescue operations of Chinese hostages. In response to the challenges brought by a prolonged pandemic, we have rolled out “Internet plus consular services” at a faster pace, including such measures as online passport application, virtual notarization, andmobile payment. The China Consular Affairs app, also launched this year, already has over 2.8 million downloads. As Chinese netizens observed, the great motherland would always give strong backing to every Chinese.Friends,Over the past year, China’s diplomacy has forged ahead in a volatile international environment, maintained composure and confidence in major-power interactions, and scored a succession of hard-won achievements. This has been made possible with the strong leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the clear guidance ofXi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.Over the past year, members of the Chinese foreign service have earnestly participated in the campaign on studying the Party’s history, continued to develop the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy Studies Center, compiled and published a Study Outline for Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, and intensified efforts to study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which provides the fundamental guidance for conducting major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era.The upcoming year of 2022 marks a critical year in the Chinese people’s march toward the second centenary goal. The Party will hold its 20th National Congress, which will be a most important event in the political life of the Party and the country. Members of the Chinese foreign service will rally even more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core and keep in alignment, enhance confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position in both the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole, and firmly uphold the Party Central Committee’s authority and its centralized, unified leadership. We will keep firmly in mind what is most important for our countryand endeavor to foster a more stable and favorable external environment for the great cause of the Party and the country.Firstly, we will make utmost efforts to ensure success of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.The Winter Olympics has entered “Beijing time”. China is confident in presenting to the world a streamlined, safe and splendidGames. We stand ready to work with the international community to promote the Olympic spirit of “mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play”, observe the UNGA resolution on Olympic Truce, reject thepoliticization of the Olympics, and make the Winter Games a global event that enhancesmutual understanding and friendship and brings countries “together for a shared future”. It will give our world greater confidence, joy, courage and strength as we continue to battle the pandemic.Secondly, we will take proactive steps to tackle the many challenges in the post-COVID era. We will continue to promote the spirit of solidarity in fighting COVID-19 and build a global community of health for all featuring both robust COVID response and heart warming cooperation. We will make good use of vaccines, a most effectiveweapon, to address the immediate priority of closing the immunization gap. We will also make greater effortsto advance cooperation on drug research, and work with all countries to build lines of defense against the virus and generate global synergy for guarding against future pandemics.Thirdly, we will push for the implementation of the Global Development Initiative. The Global Development Initiative is a public good open to the world. We will work closely with UN agencies and other countries to align the Initiative with the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and follow through on cooperationin the eight key areas of the Initiative. We will champion the development-first concept and reinvigorate global development cooperation so that no country or individual will be left behind.Fourthly, we will expand and deepen global partnerships. We will continue to deepen shoulder-by-shoulder, back-to-back strategic cooperation with Russia, making it a pillar of global stability, a bedrock for peace, and a force for fairness and justice. We will strengthen high-level strategic communication with the EU, focus on the mainstream of dialogue and cooperation,stick to the keynote of mutual benefit, and continue to be partners and not adversaries. We will pursue integrated development with our neighbors and deepen our convergence of interests and people-to-people affinity to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together. We will continue to be a sincere and reliable partner forother developing countries, support them in building capacity for self-generated development, and defend their legitimate rights to development.Fifthly, we will stay committed to promoting the steady growth of China-US relations. The year 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China. The two countries should review the spirit of that ice-melting trip, follow through on the common understandings reached between the two presidents, observe the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, abide by the three China-US Joint Communiqués, steer America’s China policy back to reason, and bring China-US relations back on the right track. The two sides need to jointly explore how two major countries with different systems, cultures and development stages can coexist in peace, for the good of the people in both countries and around the world.Sixthly, we will firmly safeguard China’s core interests. We will resolutely fight off any threats and challenges that may undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and we will firmly fight back against any despicable attempts to interfere in China’s internal affairs or discredit the country. China will continue to follow an independent foreign policy of peace, keep to the path of peaceful development, and pursue equality and mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries. We have never been subordinate to anyone, and we have never plundered others. In the meantime, we will never give in to any coercion or blackmail.Friends,The wheel of history keeps turning and justice will always prevail. Seen in the broader context of human progress, the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation represents an unstoppable trend. On our new historic journey ahead, we in the foreign service will follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy,and continue to strive for the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind,in order to make greater contributions to our country and to the world, and write new chapters for history and for the future.Thank you!
                

                Members of the Advisory Council,Friends,Good evening.It gives me great pleasure to meet with old and new friends. Let me begin byextending my warm congratulations on the opening of this year’s meeting of the Advisory Council of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. This year marks the eighth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) put forth by President Xi Jinping. Recently, President Xi Jinping attended and delivered important remarks at the third symposium on Belt and Road development. He spoke highly of the fruitful achievements in Belt and Road cooperation over the past eight years, and set outclear requirements for the continued, high-quality development of Belt and Road cooperation.The past eight years have witnessed pioneering efforts. China and the cooperation partners, guided by the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, have achievedsolid and significant outcomesin high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with hard connectivity as the direction, soft connectivity as the support and people-to-people connectivity as the bond. The past eight years have also seen hard-won progress. China and the cooperation partnershave explored new opportunities despite the global recession, and deepened cooperation against protectionism, providing impetus for recoveryand growth in various countries and opening up space for international cooperation. To date, the BRI has become the world’s largest platform for international cooperation. Friends,This year has been extraordinary in the journey of Belt and Road cooperation. Confronted by the global pandemic and a fluid international landscape, we have taken President Xi Jinping’s proposal foran even closer Belt and Road partnership as our guide, and steadilyadvanced Belt and Road international cooperation. We have achieved a series of new progress and achievements, lending new impetus to the global efforts to fight the pandemic and protect people’s well-being, and providing new underpinning for countries to boost cooperation and recover the economy. First, our practical cooperation has made steady progress. The China-Laos railway recently entered operation, and helps Laos realize its long-held dream ofturning from a land-locked to a land-linked country. The cross-sea bridge built with China-Croatia collaboration was successfully connected.Africa’s tallest skyscraper was topped out. And construction of the main body of the Qatar World Cup main stadium was completed on schedule. In the first ten months of this year, China’s investment in its cooperation partners grew by 14.6 percent, and their trade up by 23 percent. The China-Europe Railway Express completed 12,605 services and delivered 1.216 million TEUs of goods, up by 26 percent and 33 percent respectively year-on-year. With both the freight services and cargo volumes hitting record highs, the railway express has become a strong anchor of stability in the global supply chain. China has established e-commerce cooperation mechanisms with 22 countries, and its trade in cross-border e-commerce in the first half of this year rose by over 20 percent year-on-year, broadening the prospects for cooperation on Silk Road e-commerce. Second, the green Silk Road has shown great vitality. President Xi Jinping announced at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assemblythat China will step up support for other developing countries in green and low-carbon energy development, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. Over the course ofthis year, severallarge wind power, hydro-power and other clean energy projectsjointly undertaken by China and relevant countries have started operation, and China is working with Saudi Arabia on the world’s largest energy storage project. China and 31 cooperation partners jointly launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development, and the second Belt and Road Energy Ministerial Conference was successfully convened. Policy communication and practical cooperation on green and low-carbon development are advancing in a coordinated way, which have become the dual pillars of the green Silk Road.Third, the Silk Road of health has delivered remarkable progress. China has given strong support to other countries in their fight against COVID-19, providing anti-COVID supplies including vaccines, masks and protective suits on a continuous basis. Ninety percent of these supplies have gone to Belt and Road partner countries. This year, China and 31 cooperation partners jointly launched the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation, and championed closer cooperation on vaccine export, assistance, joint production, technology transfer and other areas,to build a Great Wall against COVID-19. To date, China has provided nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations, accounting for one third of all vaccines administered worldwide minus China. Chinese companies have worked with 19 developing country partners on joint vaccine production,and developed an initial annual capacity of over one billion doses. With concrete practices on the ground, China’s promise of making the vaccines a public good is becoming a reality.Fourth, the cooperation network has grown more sophisticated. This year, another seven countries signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, raising the number of BRI family members to 145. Last June, the Asia and Pacific High-level Conference on Belt and Road Cooperation was successfully held. The 30 participating countries made a joint call for fighting the pandemic in unity, speeding up a green transition and boosting sustainable recovery of the world economy. More than 40 meetings were held under Belt and Road multilateral cooperation frameworks this year, covering green development, taxation, energy, finance, disaster relief, think tanks, media, culture and arts. Chinese provinces and cities hosted a string of Belt and Road-themed events based on their respective strengths and distinctive features. In a word, Belt and Road exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been flourishing with many highlights.Experience over the past year once again shows that BRI cooperation has not stopped because of COVID-19; on the contrary, it has become a road of hope that bolsters resilience and boosts confidence. The BRI has never been a geopolitical strategy, but a road of development that helps deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and drives shared progress and prosperity. Moreover, the BRI has not created the so-called “debt trap”, but serves as a road of opportunity that delivers mutual benefit. The BRI will not damage the environment, but is a green road that facilitates low-carbon growth, environmental protection and climate response.Friends,Our world is facing the combined impacts of a pandemic and major changes unseen in a century, and the global recovery has come to a critical juncture. President Xi Jinping made it clear that the BRI needs to aim at high-standard, sustainable and people-centered growth, consolidate the basis for connectivity cooperation, open up new space for international cooperation, and work for higher-standard cooperation, better deliverables from inputs, higher-quality supply and stronger resilience in development. With that in mind, China hopes to work together with all partners on the following fronts:First, upholding a people-centered philosophy of cooperation. Meeting our people’s aspiration for a better life is why we started the BRI in the first place. We will continue to focus on economic growth, job creation, livelihood protection and poverty reduction, and deepen practical cooperation with partner countries in the economic, trade, health, poverty reduction, education and agricultural fields. We will develop more cooperation projects that improve people’s lives,todeliver more real gains to people across the partner countries. China will continue to carry out anti-COVIDcooperation with other parties. We will fulfill our commitments announced by President Xi Jinpingof providing another one billion doses of COVID vaccines to Africa and donating an additional 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. We will deepen cooperation with other developing countries on the joint production of vaccines for an early victory over COVID-19 and help bring life back to normal across countries at an early date.Second, following the cooperation principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. The BRI is the common cause of all our partners. China will step up policy communication with other parties, pursue a coordinated approach to COVID response and BRI cooperation, work with our partners on the funding support, supporting services and security safeguards of cooperation projects, and share responsibilities, risks and benefits. We need to improve bilateral, trilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to make the BRI global partnership network more solid, more substantive and more productive. Following the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency, China welcomes more countries and institutions to join tripartite or multiparty cooperation under the BRI.Recently, some countries have proposed new initiatives of international infrastructurecooperationand a regional economic framework. In China’s view, the yardstick in judging an initiative should be whether it puts development first, whether it is open and inclusive, whether it pursues mutual benefit, and whether it is action-oriented. Any attempt to sever ties among countries and the industrial and supply chains, form exclusive blocs, or even draw lines along ideology and stoke political confrontation runs counter to the trend of history and is bound to be rejected by history. Here, I wish to reiterate that China welcomes and is open to all cooperation initiatives that are truly beneficial to enhancing connectivity, boosting economic growth, improving people’s well-being and advancing social progress. China is prepared to communicate and cooperate with such initiatives to expand complementarity and forge synergy.Third, keeping to the direction of high-quality and high-standard cooperation. Belt and Road cooperation has entered the new stage of high-quality development. We will align with the widely accepted international rules and standards more proactively, carry out more high-quality projects, shape more best practices, and make sure thatprojects are sustainable economically, fiscally, financially and environmentally. We will build up connectivity with other countries, and keep global supply and industrial chains stable and smooth with joint efforts. We welcome the participation of more countries in the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development to pursue deeper cooperation on green infrastructure, green energy, green investment and green finance. We will accelerate efforts to fuel Belt and Road cooperation with digital technology, and generate more deliverables in the areas of 5G, big data and cross-border e-commerce, to help developing countries bridge the digital divide. We will continue to tackle corruption with zero tolerance, and keep the Silk Roadclean and transparent.Fourth, embracing the vision of cooperation for common development around the world. Pursuing sustainable development and delivering the UN 2030 Agenda are innate goals of the BRI cooperation. We will continue to take the BRI forward as part of the global development cause, and pursue economic, social and ecological development in a coordinated manner. Through Belt and Road cooperation, we seek to help other developing countries, especiallythe least developed ones, in their efforts to reduce poverty, and make the BRI a pathway to poverty alleviation for developing countries. China’s new development paradigm will unleash the huge vitality and potential of the big Chinese market, bringing more market and development opportunities to our BRI partners. The Global Development Initiative President Xi Jinping put forth last September aims to promote international cooperation in the eight areas of poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity. The Initiative is very much along the lineof the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and seeks more robust, greener and more balanced global development. This Initiative and the BRI may complement and reinforce each other to generate greater synergy for advancing common development.Friends,This year marks the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). One important piece of experience the CPC has gained in leading the Chinese people in the 100-year struggle isto embrace a global vision, both seeking happiness for the Chinese people and contributing to the shared progress of the world. We will stay committed to peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, the common values of humanity. We will stay committed to openness and mutual benefit, and away from isolation and zero-sum game, and provide impetus to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.The BRF Advisory Council has lent important intellectual support to Belt and Road international cooperation. The Council issued its first report in 2019, and many of the recommendations therein have been adopted. I am happy to see the Council will release a new report today, which presents its findings and suggestionsbased on the BRI’s new developments and new circumstances. We will earnestly study and make the most of the report, and hope that the Council will bring more wisdom and inputs to the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.To conclude, I wish the meeting a full success.
                

                Dakar, 30 November 2021Colleagues,Friends,On behalf of the Chinese Follow-up Committee of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), I hereby report to the Ministerial Conference the implementation of the follow-up actions of the 2018 FOCAC Beijing Summit and the Seventh Ministerial Conference.In September 2018, the 2018 FOCAC Beijing Summit and the Seventh Ministerial Conference was successfully held, which was a milestone in the history of China-Africa relations. The meeting adopted the Beijing Declaration—Toward an Even Stronger China-Africa Community with a Shared Future and the FOCAC Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021). The two sides agreed to build a China-Africa community with a shared future that features joint responsibility, win-win cooperation, happiness for all, common cultural prosperity, common security, and harmonious co-existence, and to work together on the eight major initiatives.Over the past three years, China and Africa have collaborated closely to overcome COVID-19 and other challenges and to implement the follow-ups of the Summit. So far, all follow-ups are in place, except two involving personnel exchange and training that were not yet fully implemented due to COVID-19. Specifically —First, China-Africa political mutual trust has reached a new level. High-level exchange plays an important role in guiding China-Africa relations. Overcoming the difficulties caused by COVID-19 on face-to-face interactions, our two sides have maintained high-level exchanges via video link, phone calls and in other forms. President Xi Jinping attaches high importance to China-Africa relations, and has used various ways to enhance direct communication with African leaders. On the sidelines of the G20 Summit in 2019, President Xi Jinping held a meeting with leaders of some African countries. In June 2020, President Xi Jinping, together with leaders of 13 African countries and Chairman of the Commission of the African Union (AU), convened the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, sending a strong message to the international community of China and Africa working in solidarity to tide over difficulties under the new circumstances. Since COVID-19 broke out, President Xi Jinping has had 17 telephone calls with heads of state of African countries and has, together with African leaders, charted the course for China-Africa relations. The Global Development Initiative that President Xi Jinping put forward during this year’s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly has been warmly received by many African countries.Facing the new international landscape and various global challenges, China and Africa have held high the banner of multilateralism, firmly upheld the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and worked together to promote a more just and equitable international order and safeguard the interests of all developing countries. China has firmly supported African countries in seeking strength through unity, continued to speak up for Africa on multilateral occasions, and called on the international community to scale up attention and support to the cause of peace and development of Africa. In May this year, China and Africa jointly launched the Initiative on Partnership for Africa’s Development at the UN Security Council open debate on “Peace and security in Africa: addressing root causes of conflict in post-pandemic recovery in Africa”, demonstrating their firm determination to strengthen solidarity and coordination and jointly promote equity and justice under the new circumstances.China has supported the AU, African sub-regional organizations and relevant countries in playing the leading role in settling regional conflicts. China and Africa have coordinated and collaborated closely on major regional and international issues such as the United Nations reform, climate change, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, counterterrorism, and international anti-COVID cooperation. When some Western countries attacked and smeared China using issues concerning Xinjiang and Hong Kong, many African countries, along with the vast number of developing countries, sponsored joint statements or made stand-alone statements in the UN Human Rights Council, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly and other arena in a joint effort to safeguard the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs, a basic norm governing international relations. China and Africa have supported each other’s candidates in elections in the United Nations and other important international organizations. China has given strong support to the African candidates for senior posts in the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the International Atomic Energy Agency and others. With the support of many African countries, Chinese candidates were successfully elected Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization and Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union.Second, China-Africa solidarity and mutual assistance has become a fine example of international cooperation against the pandemic. In face of the sudden onslaught of COVID-19, China and Africa have stood side by side to fight the virus and overcome the difficulties. We have actively implemented the consensus reached by our leaders at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and have put into action the vision of the China-Africa community with a shared future. At the most challenging time of China’s battle against COVID-19, African countries offered us invaluable support. And when Africa was struck by the virus, China was the first to rush in with assistance. We have sent medical experts or short-term medical teams to 17 African countries, established cooperation mechanisms with 45 hospitals in 40 African countries, and provided anti-epidemic supplies to each and every African member of FOCAC.China actively follows through President Xi Jinping’s commitment of making vaccines a global public good. It has provided over 180 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 53 African countries and the AU Commission. At the opening ceremony of the FOCAC Conference yesterday, President Xi Jinping announced another major initiative — China will provide another one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa, of which 600 million doses will be in the form of donations and the other 400 million will be jointly produced in Africa by Chinese and African companies. This is a powerful message of China and Africa working together to close the “immunization gap”. It is a strong impetus for the world to defeat COVID-19 at an early date. To help African countries tackle the pandemic and recover the economy, China is implementing in all aspects the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. It has signed debt service suspension agreements or reached common understanding with 19 African countries. China is also speeding up the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters, and is having cooperation with African countries on joint vaccine production, which will be expanded over time.Third, China-Africa business cooperation has made new progress. Facing the combined impacts of the pandemic and the major changes both unseen in a century and unbalanced recovery of the world economy, China-Africa business cooperation has maintained a strong growth momentum despite the headwind. New breakthroughs have been achieved in cooperation in digital economy, free trade, private investment and other areas, thus further deepening China-Africa cooperation and taking it to higher levels. Belt and Road cooperation has also been deepened and substantiated. Fifty-two African countries and the AU Commission have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China, providing new drivers for China-Africa cooperation. The eight major initiatives have been successfully implemented, and a large number of cooperation projects are being carried out. The US$60 billion of financing has on the whole been delivered. Among that, implementation for concessional loans and preferential export buyers’ credit was affected due to a number of factors including heavier debt burdens on African countries caused by the pandemic. Nevertheless, other forms of credit and investment have all been over-fulfilled. Later on, Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao will give a detailed briefing on the implementation of the eight major initiatives.Fourth, China-Africa people-to-people and cultural exchange has gained new development. Think tank and media exchanges and cooperation have become deeper. The China-Africa Institute was inaugurated in April 2019. Under the China-Africa Joint Research and Exchange Plan, more than 60 research projects and seminars have been implemented. The media cooperation networks have kept expanding. Nearly 30 African media organizations have joined the Belt and Road News Alliance, and a “cloud center” has been established in the China-Africa Press Center. The China-Africa Think Tanks Forum, the China-Africa Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, the Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation, and other high-quality exchange and dialogue events have been held successfully.Cultural exchanges and people-to-people interactions have kept deepening. Thirty-five cultural institutions from ten African countries have joined the Silk Road International League of Theaters, the International Alliance of Museums of the Silk Road, the Silk Road International Arts Festival, and the Silk Road International Library Alliance. The China-Africa Youth Festival, the Forum on China-Africa Local Government Cooperation, the China-Africa Young Leaders Forum, the China-Africa People’s Forum and other events were successfully held. The two sides have twinned up another 11 pairs of provinces/cities, and brought the number of sister cities to 150. Thirty-four African countries and territories have gained Approved Destination Status for organized tours of Chinese citizens, and 60 Africa-related cultural, sports and tourism programs have been launched by China. More and more fine audiovisual products from China have been translated into multiple languages and broadcast in Africa, providing an important window for Africans to learn more about China. Mariatu Kargbo and other African artists, active on the stages in China, enjoy huge popularity among the Chinese people.Fifth, China-Africa cooperation on peace and security has moved deeper and produced more deliverables. Over the past three years, China has firmly supported the African efforts to find African solutions to African issues. It worked actively to deliver to the AU the pledged military aid worth of US$100 million, plus an additional US$80 million, and earmarked 300 million RMB yuan of them for supporting the G5 Sahel Joint Force. China has promoted the implementation of the China-Africa Peace and Security Fund, surpassed the goal of completing 50 security assistance programs, and provided equipment, materials, training and other forms of assistance to Africa’s efforts in maintaining peace and stability. The first China-Africa Peace and Security Forum and the Dialogue on the Implementation of China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative were successfully held, which provided new platforms for closer exchanges and cooperation on peace and security. China has actively encouraged the UN to increase support for peacekeeping operations in Africa. China is the second largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget, and about 75 percent of its contributions are channeled to operations in Africa. China is actively involved in UN peacekeeping missions in Africa. Currently, around 1,800 Chinese peacekeepers are deployed in five UN missions on the continent, making Chinese contributions to the peacekeeping cause in Africa.Sixth, FOCAC has generated a sustained positive impact. In the 21 years since its founding, FOCAC has embraced the world trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation, and contributed enormously to the solidarity, friendship, common development, cooperation and people-to-people friendship between China and Africa. It has become a banner taking the lead in international cooperation with Africa, a forefunner in practicing multilateralism, and a fine example of pursuing mutual benefit. Its exemplary role has continued to grow, making the international community invest more in Africa and giving an impetus to Africa’s effort for lasting peace and sustainable development. In November last year, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of FOCAC, and charted its future course in continuing to take the lead in pursuing innovative growth of China-Africa relations in a new era.With the concerted efforts of both sides, FOCAC has steadily improved its institutional development. The two sides held the Coordinators’ Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of FOCAC Beijing Summit, which brought the two sides together to share ideas, coordinate actions and build consensus in pursuit of high-quality cooperation and sustainable growth of their cooperation. The 14th and 15th Meetings of Senior Officials were successfully held. The Chinese Follow-up Committee and the African diplomatic corps in China have held four rounds of consultations to ensure the efficiency of FOCAC. The sub-forums on agriculture, poverty reduction, peace and security, think tanks, media, youth, people-to-people ties, and sub-national cooperation have become more mature, and have assumed various forms of collaboration. They have further broadened and deepened China-Africa cooperation across the board and served as bridges of China-Africa friendship.Colleagues,The important achievement in China-Africa cooperation and FOCAC’s development in the past three years is the result of the joint efforts by all members to stand up to the challenges in the FOCAC spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. It demonstrated our common aspiration and strong determination for stronger solidarity and closer cooperation under the new circumstances. It also displayed the remarkable resilience and vitality of China-Africa cooperation in face of the unique challenge of COVID-19.Achievements in the past are hard-won and valuable, but what awaits ahead is even more promising. We have harvested not just fruitful results from our cooperation, but also greater confidence and motivation. Let us learn from past experience, build strategic consensus, further improve the quality of our cooperation, and elevate our mutually beneficial cooperation and common development to higher levels so as to deliver greater benefits to both Chinese and African peoples.That is my report to this Conference on the implementation of the follow-up actions of the FOCAC Beijing Summit.Thank you.
                

                Beijing International Club, 2 December 2021Distinguished Friends,Good afternoon! I’m very glad to join you again in this dialogue.Recently, democracy is being widely discussed around the world. This should have been a good thing. But a very few countries are using democracy as a cover: they twist its essence, and willfully set its standards. They even take democracy as a political tool for selfish gains, and build small blocs to create division and confrontation in the world. This obviously runs against the spirit of democracy.Therefore, today’s dialogue on democracy is very necessary. Through our interaction, we hope to clear up confusion, promote right conceptions, and look for the right way of democracy. I wish to share with you a few of my thoughts.The first question I’d like to answer is: Is China a democracy or not? Some in the West claim that there seems to be no democracy in China, and that the Communist Party of China is just authoritarian and autocratic. In their eyes, although China has created many miracles of long-term stability, rapid development and poverty reduction, and the government has the universal support of the Chinese people, yet China is still a country without democracy and without human rights.This actually reveals their hostile mindsets and intentions, namely, democracy is just a tool to repress anyone who disagrees with them and to contain the development of other countries.This year marks the 100th birthday of the CPC. For 100 years, China has never stopped its efforts to pursue and advance democracy. Many people have watched The Age of Awakening, a popular TV series. I was deeply impressed by one of the scenes—Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao and other CPC founders walking back and forth on a muddy path in the early 20th century, looking for ways to democracy and freedom.Starting from that muddy path, the CPC led the Chinese people on a great journey of the century. In the early 1930s, the CPC established the congress of workers, peasants and soldiers in Ruijin, capital of the Chinese Soviet Republic. While in Yan’an, peasants, who could not read, would vote for their ideal candidates by casting beans as ballots. U.S. journalist Edgar Snow was deeply impressed by his visit to Yan’an. He said what he saw there was the best of human history, and a light of rejuvenation in the East.After the founding of the People’s Republic, China’s democracy has stepped into a new stage, and made steady and historic progress. In particular, since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has deepened the knowledge on the laws of democracy, and proposed the important concept of “whole-process people’s democracy”. This is a major innovation on the people’s democratic system. Socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is now in a new era.Many of my colleagues and friends hope to see sequels to The Age of Awakening. I would ask them: Don’t you think the prosperous, dynamic, free and democratic China today is the best sequel? Our forefathers’ dream of democracy is now a reality, and the whole-process people’s democracy is the best answer to their life-long struggle.China’s whole-process people’s democracy is not for the few or an interest group. It is for the majority and the whole Chinese people. All the 2.62 million deputies in the five levels of people’s congresses, from the National People’s Congress down to provinces, cities, counties, and townships, are elected by the people. The people in China participate extensively in state affairs, especiallylocal-level governance, to exercise their constitutional rights. Among the deputies to the 13th National People’s Congress, frontline workers, farmers and people with special skills take up a much bigger share. This shows the broadness of the NPC deputies and the extensive political participation by the people.China’s whole-process people’s democracy is not a show, or a formality. It truly makes the people happy, and improves their well-being. In the past decades, more than 800 million Chinese have been lifted out of extreme poverty, a miracle unseen anywhere in the world. China has also built the world’s largest social security system and healthcare system, covering more than 1.3 billion people.Jobs are the most important part of people’s well-being. More than 10 million new jobs were created each year for 15 consecutive years, a number equivalent to the population of a mid-sized country. So far, 1.08 billion Chinese have been fully vaccinated against COVID. And community workers in the 600,000 communities across China are keeping up to speed everyone’s vaccination.China’s whole-process people’s democracy is not the kind that wakes up at the time of voting and goes back to dormant afterwards. Instead, itensures that the people have the full right to know, to express, and to supervise. It means that the people participate in every part of democracy. “From the people, to the people”— this is an important way of China’s democratic practices. All major law-making decisions in China are the result of a democratic process. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the public has been called on to comment on 187 draft laws. Around 1.1 million comments were collected, with more than 3 million suggestions. When drafting the 14th Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also asked the public for advice. On the Internet alone, the government received more than one million proposals.Both history and reality have fully proved that China’s model of democracy fits in well with its national conditions. It enjoys the support of the people. It is real, effective, and successful democracy. China is indeed a true democratic country. That muddy path in the early 20th century has become a broad, straight road leading the 1.4 billion Chinese people togreater democracy, freedom, prosperity and better lives.China’s success in democracy highlights an important lesson: transplanted democracy does not work, and countries should not be lectured about how to build their own democracy. In other words, for democracy to succeed in a country, it must take deep roots in that country, and make its own people happy and satisfied.We in China often say that “language dialects change every ten miles, and folk customs differ every 100 miles”. Even on the Chinese territory, there are many different features— the rich plains in the northeast and the dry yellow northwest, the wet south and the immense grasslands north. Different soils produce different crops and cultures. And that is also true with the diverse world with so many countries. As the saying goes that personality is shaped by the environment, democracy should also be moulded by the conditions on the ground. No two leaves in the world are completely the same. Likewise, a one-size-fits-all model of democracy for the whole world does not exist, and there is no democratic system that can claim to be perfect or superior to others.If you look at China’s path to democracy in modern times, you will see that we suffered a lot and paid a heavy price by simply copying the models from other countries. If you look at the world, be it in Afghanistan, Libya or Iraq, democracy imposed through color revolutions all ended in catastrophe. And at the end of the day, it is the innocent people that bear the brunt.Friends,Our world is going through a pandemic and changes unseen in a century. Humanity faces unprecedented risks and challenges. Now more than ever, the world needs to come together and respond collectively. Acertain country is putting together the so-called democracy summit as self-styled leader of democracy. It divides countries into different levels of a hierarchy, labels them as democratic or undemocratic, and points fingers at other countries’ democratic systems. It claimsit is doing this for democracy. But this is in fact the very opposite of democracy. It will do no good to global solidarity and cooperation or promote global development.In essence, democracy needs to be in touch with the people. It needs to keep in mind what policies people want; what their needs are; and how to make their lives better. Democracy is not to be put on a pedestal. It is not about grandstanding. And it should not be out of touch with the general public. In today’s world of uncertainties, fighting COVID-19 remains a top priority. The coronavirus has claimed over 5.2 million lives worldwide. The U.S. alone lost over 800,000 lives to COVID. This is heart-wrenching. This tragedy must not continue.According to the WHO, more than 80 countries are still unable to vaccinate 40 percent of their adults by the end of this year. Many of them are African countries. What is worse, the new and formidable variant Omicron is now posing a severe threat to the African people. To help address these challenges, China has been providing assistance to people in Africa. At the recent Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, President Xi Jinping announced major steps in support of Africa, including another one billion doses of vaccines to African countries, 10 medical and health projects, and 1,500 medical personnel and public health experts.In addition to COVID-19, we also face many other challenges including climate change, inflation, energy security, and refugees and migrants. The clock is ticking for all countries to work together to find a solution. Let us return to what democracy is really about, get in touch with the people, and do more to improve their lives.With that, I conclude my remarks, which I hope would be useful and meaningful for your discussions. I wish this dialogue a full success. Thank you.
                

                Guangzhou, 2 December 2021Chairman Zheng Bijian,Vice Minister Lv Yansong,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,It gives me great pleasure to meet friends old and new in Guangzhou, the city of flowers. The Understanding China Conference, now in its fifth year, provides aforum forChinese and foreign participants to renew friendship and promote cooperation, and contribute their ideas and expertiseto enhancing mutual understanding and trust between China and the world.In his video address, President Xi Jinping stressed that to understand China today, one must strive to understand the Communist Party of China (CPC). TheCPC celebrates its centenary this year. This is a particularly important time for discussing“Whence and Whither—Unprecedented Changes in the World and China and the CPC”,the theme of this conference.In this connection, I bring the warm congratulations of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the Chinese Foreign Ministry. We wish your conference a complete success.Three weeks ago, the CPC held the sixth Plenary Session of its 19th Central Committee. The plenary summed up the major achievements and historical experience of the Party over the past century, andlooked back on the great efforts the Party has madefor the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It alsoreviewed the dedicated efforts and valuable ideas the Party has contributed to world peace, development and human progress.History is a mirror through which we can better understand the future. Under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people have set outconfidently on a new journey toward realizing the Second Centenary Goal and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.Diplomacy is an important part of the Party’s lofty cause and epic struggle. Under the strongleadership of the CPC Central Committee, China's diplomacy has traveled an extraordinary journey against great odds. Since the 18th Party Congress in 2012, General Secretary Xi Jinping has kept global and domestic developments in mind and provided overall leadership for the conduct of Chinese diplomacy. By carrying forward our fine diplomatic traditions and breaking new ground in practice, we have forged anunyielding spirit and unique style in diplomacy, and opened up new horizons inmajor-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.In this context, let me share with you four watchwords for understanding China's foreign policy in the new era:The first watchword is independence.This is thecornerstone of China's diplomacy.Ancient Chinese philosophers observed that “as heaven maintains vigor through constant movement, a gentleman should continually strive for self-perfection”. In international affairs, China determines its position and policy based on the fundamental interests of the people both in China and around the world, and on the merits of the issue. China never subordinates itself to others or coerces others into submission. China never provokes trouble, but is not afraid of provocation. Even in a complex and challenging international situation, and faced with external pressure and bullying, China never flinches or bends its knees.We always think on our own, follow our own path and keep our destiny in our own hands. We never stand down when it comes toprotecting our sovereignty, security and development interest. We never trade away our principles. This approach has earned us international understanding and respect; it has also boosted the confidence and courage of other countries and nations that wish to maintain their independence.In recent months, a disturbing trend may have caught your attention. Some forces in certain countries are trying to contain China by playingthe “Taiwan card”. Publicly and covertly,they are encouraging separatist forces on the island to challenge the red line of “one China”. Let me make this very clear: the one-China principle is the political foundation of China's relations with other countries. It is also theshared consensus, firmposition and common will of the international community. The principle is not to be distorted or altered, still less overturned. On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we have no room for compromise. No one should ever expect China toaccept any damage to its core interests.The second watchword is peaceful development.This is the defining feature of China's diplomacy.Amity and good-neighborliness are invaluable to a country. China’s development has only one goal: to deliver a better life for our people. China is committed to the path of peaceful development. It is developing itself by securing a peaceful global environment and, at the same time, contributing to world peace with its own development.Some people, though, keep peddling the theory that a rising power is bound to seek global hegemony. They are judging others based on their own experience. What they are doing only lays bare their hegemonic habit and twistedmentality. If history is any guide, itis that a hegemonic country invariably goes into decline. So no matter what stage of development China reaches, it will never seek hegemony or territorialexpansion, or export its ideology.The third watchword is win-win cooperation.This is the guiding principle of China's diplomacy.As a Chinese proverb goes, “When people are united with one heart and one mind, success is assured.” Seeing its development as part of the global development, China has opened up to the world in pursuit of common interests and shared opportunities with the worldthrough cooperation. We are committed to upholding the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its heart, and to making economic globalizationmore open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.In our view, people who share the same goal can become friends, and peoplewho seek common ground despite their differences can be partners. China has recently put forward a Global Development Initiative. It is designed to foster more robust, greener and more balanced global development andmake bigger the pie of mutually beneficial cooperation.The fourth watchword is fairness and justice. This is the aspiration of China's diplomacy.Ancient Chinese philosophy teaches us to “both strengthen ourselves and help others where possible”. China is always on the side of human progress. We try to do our best for the world, and contribute Chinese wisdom, initiative and resources to help solve global problems. In the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, we believe that global affairs should be discussed by all. We are committed to increasing the representation and voice of developing countries, advancing democracy and rule of law in international relations, and fostering a new type of international relations.We stand for true multilateralism, and oppose the creation of exclusiveblocs or“a new Cold War”.We are committed to safeguarding the international system that centers around the United Nations, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.Our approach is different from some country, which refuses to face and address its own human rights record, and tries instead to pose as an advocate and judge of human rights around the world. As a most recent example, it will convene a so-called “summit for democracy”. People cannot help but wonder: who has given it such mandate? And on what ground can it decide for the over 200 countries and regions in the world? A summit like this is anything but democratic. It is a clear act of hegemony, a futile bluff, a pretext for deflecting attention from its domestic problems, and a tool to serve its geopolitical agenda. The summit will only create new divisions and fuel ideological confrontation, and bring turbulence and instability to the world. The international community must be clear-eyed and say no to this sham.Ladies and Gentlemen,Since the 18th Party Congress in 2012, President Xi Jinping has showna keenunderstanding of the global trends and dynamics and kept the common good of humanity in mind. He has called for building a community with a shared future for mankind, which set the direction and goal for China's diplomacy in the new era.President Xi's vision is based on the recognition that humanity is an integral community and Earth is our common homeland. No person or country can thrive in isolation. That is why we need to live in peace and can only prosper together. To build a community with a shared future for mankind, all countries must rise above their differences in history, culture, ethnicity, religion and social system, and promote peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity. We must make the best possible efforts to meet the shared aspirations of people around the world for a better life, and work together topreserve the planet Earth, the one and only home we have.Ladies and Gentlemen,Two weeks ago, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a candid, in-depth and productive virtual meeting and charted the course of China-US relations at a crucial moment. With the future of this important relationship in mind, President Xi set forth the right way for China and the United States to get along in the new era, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. To be specific, mutual respect is the precondition for interactions between countries, peaceful coexistence is the only choice available tothe two countries, and win-win cooperation is the surest path to better China-US relations. President Xi also laid out four priority areas where China and the US should, need to and can work together for the benefit of both countries and the world at large.It is our hope that the United Stateswill work with China toact on the common understandingand strategic guidance of our presidents, and bring China-US relations back to thetrack of sound and steady growth. This will provide reassurance to our two peoples and set the rest of the world at ease.  In closing, I wish your conference a full success!Thank you!
                

                Friends from AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, USCBC and CASIC,Ladies and Gentlemen,It’s always a pleasure to talk to representatives from the U.S. business community and states and cities. With courage and foresight, you were among the first to come to China since reform and opening-up, or what we in China say “the first to taste the crab”. With commitment and resilience, you have taken firm root in China for decades. With resourcefulness and ingenuity, you have explored effective working modes such as virtual visits and “doorknocks” even during COVID. So let me first of all pay tribute to you for what you have done.Our meeting today cannot come at a more fitting time, right on the heels of two historic events, one in China, and the other between China and the United States. Both are good news and will have a direct impact on you.The first major event is the successful conclusion of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee.This important plenum was held at the centenary of the CPC and a historic juncture where the Two Centenary Goals converge. The Central Committee adopted the Resolution on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century, which answers a question of fundamental importance: namely why the CPC succeeded in the past, and how it will continue to succeed in the future.The Resolution is a proud scoreboard that reviews the CPC’s major achievements and historical experience over the past century.It explains how the CPC has led a nation, once on the verge of collapse, to liberation and independence; how the CPC has led a country, once poor and weak, to become the world’s second largest economy; and how the CPC has completed two miracles in a huge country, namely rapid economic growth and long-term social stability.In the meantime, China has developed the world’s biggest systems of social security and universal education, and lifted 770 million people out of extreme poverty. The 1.4 billion Chinese people now live a moderately prosperous life. All these not only benefit each and every Chinese but also represent historic contributions to the world.These facts help to show that the CPC is one of the most successful political parties in the world, and socialism with Chinese characteristics is a most successful development path that fits China’s conditions. The 10 points of experience summed up in the Resolution are the recipe for the CPC’s success, and hold the key to the dynamism and continued success of China.     The Resolution is a future-oriented declaration that the CPC is leading the Chinese people on a new journey.The CPC is by no means complacent about what it has accomplished. China’s development is still uneven and inadequate. Our per capita GDP is only one sixth of that of the U.S.The aspirations of our people for a better life is our mission. The CPC will not rest on its laurels. We will keep working hard and lead the Chinese people to build a modern socialist country in all respects and realize the Second Centenary Goal.We will ground our work in this new stage of development, apply the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and promote high-quality development. We need to both make the economic pie bigger and divide it fairly. We are encouraging those having got prosperous first to help others catch up and expanding the middle-income group, so as to steadily achieve common prosperity for all.The Resolution is a sincere invitation to the world as China welcomes with open arms the U.S. and other countries to share in its development opportunities.The reform and opening-up was a crucial move in making China what it is today. As stressed by President Xi Jinping recently at the opening of the fourth China International Import Expo, we will not change our resolve to open wider at a high standard, and we will not change our determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world.China has introduced a series of additional policies to further open up its economy. The negative list for foreign investment has been shortened by two-thirds in four years; the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are essentially liberalized; foreign equity caps on insurance, securities, fund management and futures services have all been lifted. Citigroup, BlackRock and J.P. Morgan are among the first American firms to benefit from these policies.In the 2020 edition of the catalogue, the number of Chinese industries open to foreign investment grew by 12 percent. Economic reliefs in response to COVID have been applied to domestic and foreign firms alike.As a Chinese proverb goes, “When spring has warmed the stream, ducks are the first to know.” Capital is most sensitive to economic conditions and “vote with its feet”. Last year, China became the largest destination of foreign capital flows — a vote of confidence in China’s business environment and development prospects. China’s door will only open wider and will never be closed. The world will benefit from the strengths of China’s stability, system, market, production factors and human resources as more dividends are released.The second major event I referred to earlier is the virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden.The successful virtual meeting took place two weeks ago. It had great significance not only for China-U.S. relations, but also for international relations. In a good atmosphere, our Presidents had candid, in-depth and constructive discussions, and the meeting was extended several times to three and a half hours in total. It was a substantive and fruitful meeting.The meeting augurs well for both China and the U.S., and the world at large.Both China and the U.S. are at a crucial stage of development,and the world is in a time of turbulence and change. Our two countries are like two giant ships battling high winds and rough waters. A presidential meeting on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance will help steer the course of China-U.S. relations. It is of great significance and will have a far-reaching impact.During the meeting, both Presidents underscored the importance of our bilateral relationship and their belief that we must get it right and never mess it up. Both expressed their opposition to a “new Cold War” or confrontation and conflict between China and the U.S. They sent a strong message to our two countries and the world that China-U.S. relations should and must return to the right track of sound and steady development.The meeting has raised international expectations and provided a palpable sense of stability and certainty for the world. Shortly after the meeting was concluded, stock markets rallied with an average 0.64 percent rise in China’s three major stock exchanges and a 0.43 percent rise in the three major U.S. stocks indexes.The meeting reflects China’s sincerity and sense of responsibility in developing its relations with the U.S.With farsightedness and vision, President Xi Jinping put forward three principles for China-U.S. ties in the new era, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. He also highlighted four priority areas. First, shouldering responsibilities as major countries and marshalling a global response to acute challenges. Second, acting in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit to promote exchanges at all levels and in all areas and generate more positives for China-U.S. relations. Third, managing differences and sensitive issues constructively to prevent China-U.S. relations from getting derailed or out of control. And fourth, strengthening coordination and cooperation on major international and regional issues and provide more global public goods.The meeting generates important common understandings conducive to China-U.S. practical cooperation.The two sides agreed to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against economic and financial risks. The two sides also agreed to work together on global issues such as energy security, climate change and public health. This will help stabilize and improve the international economic environment and address what are dubbed “gray rhinos” and “black swans”, high-impact events that are often neglected or dismissed.President Xi Jinping pointed out that our two countries enjoy common interests in a wide range of areas and should complement each other and make the pie bigger for China-U.S. cooperation. He highlighted the economy, energy, education, science, technology and environment as potential growth areas and opportunities for China-U.S. cooperation.The two sides agreed to fully harness the dialogue channels and mechanisms between our economic, trade and financial teams to advance practical cooperation and resolve specific issues. This will help anchor expectations and address each side’s concerns.President Xi Jinping affirmed that China is fostering domestic and international economic circulations with greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more market-oriented, law-based and consistent with international standards. This is a reassuring statement to the U.S. and the rest of the world.What is perhaps of immediate relevance for you is that President Xi Jinping announced China’s readiness to upgrade fast-track travel arrangements with the U.S.The U.S. business community have raised difficulties in traveling to China amid the pandemic. We attach great importance to your concerns, and President Xi Jinping is personally committed to seeing the issue resolved. Of course, the fast-track arrangement will also include contingency plans such as “circuit-breaker” measures, which are aimed to ensure both effective COVID response and sound economic and social development, lower the risks of cross infection among travelers to China, and help American firms here operate in a safer, better protected and more sustainable way.Friends, the Sixth Plenum and the virtual presidential meeting are giving us more confidence about the future.I encourage you to act quickly, leverage your strengths, get a head start and become “early birds” in reaping benefits from China-U.S. cooperation.First, I hope you will be participants in and contributors to China’s opening-up at a higher level so as to achieve win-win and all-win outcomes.Fortune will smile on those who choose to work with China. Among the over 70,000 American businesses in China, 97 percent are reaping profits. It is estimated that China will import 2.5 trillion dollars worth of goods and services annually in the coming 15 years, its middle-income group will swell to 800 million by 2035, its airlines will need 8,700 new aircraft by 2040, and its green finance market will be worth 100 trillion yuan by 2060. All this will inject tremendous impetus into economic, trade and sub-national cooperation between our two countries.Recently, China and the U.S. released a joint declaration on enhanced climate actions on the sidelines of COP26. Green economy will be a new growth area in our cooperation. We have every reason to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation in PV technology, circular economy, energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transportation and power batteries.Incidentally, maybe you’ve noticed that other players are also doing the best. In the first ten months of this year, the EU’s trade with China exceeded 670 billion dollars, roughly 50 billion dollars more than U.S. trade with China. Also in the first ten months of this year, the number of freight services between China and Europe has already surpassed the total of last year and it is still growing with a strong momentum. So I encourage our American friends to step up with eyes wide open, or you might miss the “express train” of China’s modernization.Second, I hope you will be pioneers and cheerleaders for stabilizing and promoting China-U.S. relations.China-U.S. economic cooperation and trade do not happen in a vacuum and are inevitably influenced by the broader relationship. As a Chinese proverb goes, “When a tree flourishes, people can enjoy the cool of its shade.” When the overall atmosphere of China-U.S. relations is good, economic cooperation and trade will do better. When bilateral relations deteriorate, business communities can’t expect to be unaffected and make money quietly.It has come to my attention that over the past four decades and more, even when China-U.S. relations encountered difficulties, the China business reports released by AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, USCBC and relevant U.S. states and cities presented the situation objectively, pointed out that China-U.S. business ties are mutually beneficial, and expressed confidence in and commitment to China-U.S. cooperation. We highly appreciate that, and we hope you will continue to play a unique and important role, speak out for what is right, and encourage the U.S. administration to follow a sensible and pragmatic China policy and to stop waging trade war, industrial war or technology war and stop creating confrontation or conflict over values, ideology or geopolitics.Third, I hope you will be carers and doers in advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the U.S., and oppose the politicization of economic and trade issues.As an early comer, the United States used to be an advocate of globalization. I still remember in the early 2000s and before that, the United States went to great lengths to persuade China to join the WTO and lectured us about free trade and market economics. To be honest, when diving into the vast ocean of the global market, China had its fair share of choking and ran considerable risks. Fortunately, although we were a latecomer to the game, we overcame the obstacles.If the early comer can’t accept the fact that the latecomer may do better than the early comer in some areas, and tries to change the rules of the game to hold the latecomer back, it would be most narrow-minded, not to mention unfair. International trade rules are decided by countries through consultation and ought to be observed by all. They should not be misused, discarded or selectively implemented. Disrupting the rules may bring some benefits for the time being, but would eventually upset the cart and rattle markets, and it won’t do any good to anybody.The U.S. side used to be a strong advocate of the view that business is business. But these days, political correctness seems to trump everything in the U.S. It reminds me of a saying in China during the Cultural Revolution, “I’d rather have socialist wild grass than capitalist crop seedlings.” Be it decoupling, supply cutoff, “a small yard surrounded by high fences” or trying to form small supply chain blocs against China, they all violate the laws of the market, disrupt international division of labor, disturb global industrial and supply chains, and try to divide the world economy into two parallel systems. The business community will have to bear double costs, in which situation how could they enjoy efficiency or benefits?I hope that our friends in the business community can take a clear stand against politicizing economic and trade issues and abusing the concept of national security. I hope you can work on the Biden administration to lift the tariff hikes, stop suppressing and sanctioning Chinese businesses, prevent the passage on Capitol Hill of the Innovation and Competition Act and other acts on China. It is important to create a level playing field for Chinese and American businesses to engage in healthy competition rather than vicious zero-sum games. We must help both sides grow rather than drag them all down.Fourth, I hope you will build bridges and ties of friendship between Chinese and American people, and help improve mutual understanding and trust.Amity between the people holds the key to good relations between countries. Working and living here, you all engage extensively with Chinese society and interact in depth with Chinese people. Among foreigners, you know China the best and should have the most say. I hope you will spread the word on what you have seen, heard and felt here to the other side of the Pacific. No need for exaggerated praises. Just tell the truth, so that the average Americans can have a full and objective picture of the real China.I’m sure you are all aware that issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet concern China’s sovereignty, security and development, which are our core interests. They bear on the national sentiment of 1.4 billion Chinese people. For the Chinese side, there is simply no room for compromise. I hope you will use your influence to urge the U.S. administration to truly abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués and honor the true one-China policy, which should not be altered, distorted or negated.The Olympic Games are a celebration of our common humanity. The principle of political neutrality is enshrined in the Olympic Charter. Earlier this year, the International Olympic Committee has unanimously decided to add the word “together” to the Olympic motto, which now reads “Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together”. Boycotting the Olympic Games for political reasons would harm the interests of athletes and go against the common aspiration of the international community. Beijing will host the Winter Olympics next February, and Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028. China and the United States need to support each other and jointly honor the Olympic spirit of solidarity, friendship, fair play and mutual understanding. In this regard, I count on positive contributions from the U.S. business community and states and cities.Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the Eighth Ministerial Conference ofThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation29 November 2021Your Excellency President Macky Sall,Distinguished Colleagues,Dear Guests and Friends,It is such a pleasure to attend the opening ceremony of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Let me first express sincere appreciation to President Sall and the government of Senegal for their excellent organization, and extend a warm welcome to the colleagues and guests attending the Conference. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations between China and African countries. Over the past 65 years, China and Africa have forged unbreakable fraternity in our struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and embarked on a distinct path of cooperation in our journey toward development and revitalization. Together, we have written a splendid chapter of mutual assistance amidst complex changes, and set a shining example for building a new type of international relations. Dear Friends,Why do China and Africa have such a close relationship and so deep a bond of friendship? The key lies in an everlasting spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation forged between the two sides, which features sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness. This truly captures the relations of China and Africa working together in good and hard times over the past decades, and provides a source of strength for the continuous growth of China-Africa friendly relations.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of China’s lawful seat in the United Nations. Here, let me express sincere appreciation to the many African friends who supported China back then. Let me also make it solemnly clear that China will never forget the profound friendship of African countries and will remain guided by the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. China will work together with African friends to promote and carry forward the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation from generation to generation. Dear Friends,At the 2018 FOCAC Beijing Summit, I proposed that we build an even stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. The proposal was unanimously endorsed by African leaders. Over the past three years and more, China and Africa have worked together to fully implement the eight major initiatives and other outcomes of the Beijing Summit, and completed a large number of priority cooperation projects. China-Africa trade and China’s investment in Africa have been on a steady rise. Almost all African members of FOCAC have joined the big family of Belt and Road cooperation. All these have injected strong impetus into the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. As we stand at the historic starting point of building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, I wish to make the following four proposals:First, fighting COVID-19 with solidarity. We need to put people and their lives first, be guided by science, support waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and truly ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in Africa to bridge the immunization gap. Second, deepening practical cooperation. We need to open up new prospects for China-Africa cooperation, expand trade and investment, share experience on poverty reduction, strengthen cooperation on digital economy, and promote entrepreneurship by young Africans and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). At the UN General Assembly this year, I put forward the Global Development Initiative, which dovetails with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We welcome the active support and participation by African countries. Third, promoting green development. In the face of climate change, which is a major challenge to all humanity, we need to advocate green and low-carbon development, actively promote solar, wind and other sources of renewable energy, work for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and keep strengthening our capacity for sustainable development. Fourth, upholding equity and justice. The world needs true multilateralism. Peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of humanity and represent the abiding aspirations of both China and Africa. We both advocate a development path suited to our national conditions and are both committed to upholding the rights and interests of developing countries. We both oppose intervention in domestic affairs, racial discrimination and unilateral sanctions. We need to unequivocally stand for the just propositions of developing countries and translate our common aspirations and interests into joint actions.   Dear Friends,In the run-up to this Conference, our two sides have jointly prepared the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035. Under the first three-year plan of the Vision, China will work closely with African countries to implement the following nine programs:First, the medical and health program. To help the AU achieve its goal of vaccinating 60 percent of the African population by 2022, I announce that China will provide another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa, including 600 million doses as donation and 400 million doses to be provided through such means as joint production by Chinese companies and relevant African countries. In addition, China will undertake 10 medical and health projects for African countries, and send 1,500 medical personnel and public health experts to Africa.Second, the poverty reduction and agricultural development program. China will undertake 10 poverty reduction and agricultural projects for Africa, and send 500 agricultural experts to Africa. China will set up a number of China-Africa joint centers for modern agrotechnology exchange, demonstration and training in China, encourage Chinese institutions and companies to build in Africa demonstration villages for China-Africa cooperation on agricultural development and poverty reduction, and support the Alliance of Chinese Companies in Africa for Corporate Social Responsibilities in launching the initiative of “100 Companies in 1,000 Villages”.Third, the trade promotion program. China will open “green lanes” for African agricultural exports to China, speed up the inspection and quarantine procedures, and further increase the scope of products enjoying zero-tariff treatment for the least developed countries (LDCs) having diplomatic relations with China, in a bid to reach 300 billion US dollars in total imports from Africa in the next three years. China will provide 10 billion US dollars of trade finance to support African export, and build in China a pioneering zone for in-depth China-Africa trade and economic cooperation and a China-Africa industrial park for Belt and Road cooperation. China will undertake 10 connectivity projects for Africa, form an expert group on economic cooperation with the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and give continued support to the development of the AfCFTA.Fourth, the investment promotion program. China will encourage its businesses to invest no less than 10 billion US dollars in Africa in the next three years, and will establish a platform for China-Africa private investment promotion. China will undertake 10 industrialization and employment promotion projects for Africa, provide credit facilities of 10 billion US dollars to African financial institutions, support the development of African SMEs on a priority basis, and establish a China-Africa cross-border RMB center. China will exempt African LDCs from debt incurred in the form of interest-free Chinese government loans due by the end of 2021. China is ready to channel to African countries 10 billion US dollars from its share of the IMF’s new allocation of Special Drawing Rights.Fifth, the digital innovation program. China will undertake 10 digital economy projects for Africa, set up centers for China-Africa cooperation on satellite remote-sensing application, and support the development of China-Africa joint laboratories, partner institutes, and scientific and technological innovation cooperation bases. China will work with African countries to expand Silk Road e-commerce cooperation, hold online shopping festivals featuring quality African products and tourism e-commerce promotion activities, and launch a campaign to market 100 African stores and 1,000 African products on e-commerce platforms.Sixth, the green development program. China will undertake 10 green development, environmental protection and climate action projects for Africa, support the development of the “Great Green Wall”, and build in Africa centers of excellence on low-carbon development and climate change adaptation.Seventh, the capacity building program. China will help build or upgrade 10 schools in Africa, and invite 10,000 high-level African professionals to seminars and workshops. We will implement “Future of Africa — a project for China-Africa cooperation on vocational education”, and start an employment “through train” scheme for African students in China. China will continue to work with African countries to set up “Luban Workshops”, and encourage Chinese companies in Africa to create at least 800,000 local jobs.Eighth, the cultural and people-to-people exchange program. China will support making all African countries having diplomatic ties with China approved destinations for Chinese tourist groups. We will hold African film festivals in China and Chinese film festivals in Africa, as well as a China-Africa youth services forum, and a China-Africa women’s forum.Ninth, the peace and security program. China will undertake 10 peace and security projects for Africa, continue to deliver military assistance to the AU, support African countries’ efforts to independently maintain regional security and fight terrorism, and conduct joint exercises and on-site training between Chinese and African peacekeeping troops and cooperation on small arms and light weapons control.Dear Friends,Senegal’s first President Léopold Sédar Senghor once wrote, “Let us answer ‘present’ at the rebirth of the world.” I am convinced that the concerted efforts of China and Africa will make this FOCAC Conference a full success, one that shall pool the mighty strength of the 2.7 billion Chinese and Africans and guide us toward a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future.Thank you.
                

                Q1:This is the first ever  virtual meeting between the Chinese and U.S. Presidents, and the two leaders had  quite a long discussion. Did the meeting achieve its objective?A: On the morning of 16 November,  Chinese President Xi Jinping had a virtual meeting with U.S. President Joe  Biden. This is the first ever virtual meeting between the two heads of state in  the history of China-U.S. relations. It has great significance for both  China-U.S. bilateral ties and international relations. The meeting lasted for  three and a half hours, from 8:45 a.m. to around 12:25 p.m. Beijing time, longer  than scheduled. The two sides had an extensive exchange of views on the  strategic, overarching and fundamental issues in China-U.S. relations, on their  respective development agenda and domestic and foreign policies, and on  international and regional issues of mutual interest. It was a candid, in-depth,  constructive and fruitful meeting. Under the current circumstances, it is  crucial that the two Presidents take the helm for the China-U.S. relationship.  The meeting has chartered the course and provided impetus for China-U.S.  relations to develop going forward.Q2:The meeting has  covered major strategic issues about the future of China-U.S. relations and  important issues of shared interest and concern. Could you tell us more details  about what has been discussed? Any consensus reached?A: The meeting can be recapped by  a set of figures-3, 4, 2 and 1. To be specific, President Xi put forward  three principles and four priority areas for growing China-U.S.  relations; the two Presidents reached two principled common  understandings; President Xi Jinping worked on the U.S. side on  one important question.On the three  principles. At the meeting, President Xi pointed out the right way for  China and the United States to get along in the new era: First, mutual  respect. The two sides need to respect each other's social systems and  development paths, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and  respect each other's right to development. They need to treat each other as  equals, keep differences under control, and seek common ground while reserving  differences. Second, peaceful coexistence. No conflict and no  confrontation is a line that both sides must hold. Third, win-win  cooperation. The interests of China and the United States are deeply  intertwined. The world is big enough for our two countries to develop  individually and collectively. The right thing to do is to choose mutual benefit  over zero-sum game or the I-win-you-lose approach.On the four priority  areas. President Xi identified at the meeting four areas where China  and the United States should focus their efforts on:First, shouldering  responsibilities of major countries and leading global response to outstanding  challenges. China-U.S. cooperation may not solve all problems, but few  problems can be solved without it. The global initiatives China has proposed are  open to the United States, and we hope the same is true for initiatives from the  United States.Second, acting in the  spirit of equality and mutual benefit to move forward exchanges at all levels  and in all areas and generate more positive energy for China-U.S.  relations. The two Presidents have stayed in close contact through  meetings, letters and phone calls, chartering the course for bilateral  relations. The two countries, with broad common interests in a wide range of  areas including economy, energy, mil-to-mil, law-enforcement, education, science  and technology, cyber, environmental protection and sub-national cooperation,  may draw on what each other has to offer and make the cake bigger for China-U.S.  cooperation. Our two sides could fully harness the channels and mechanisms of  dialogue between our diplomatic and security, economy, trade and finance, and  climate change teams, in an effort to advance practical cooperation and resolve  specific issues.Third, managing  differences and sensitive issues in a constructive way to prevent China-U.S.  relations from getting derailed or out of control. It is only natural  for our two countries to have differences. What matters is to manage differences  in a constructive manner and prevent them from getting magnified or escalated.  China stands firm in defending its sovereignty, security and development  interests. It is important that the United States handle the relevant issues  with prudence.Fourth, strengthening  coordination and cooperation on major international and regional hotspot issues  to provide more public goods to the world. In a world that is still not  peaceful, China and the United States need to work together with the rest of the  international community to defend world peace, promote global development, and  safeguard a fair and equitable international order.On the two principled  common understandings. Both Presidents underscored the importance of China-U.S.  relations. President Xi noted the importance of the China-U.S.  relationship to the two countries and, beyond the bilateral scope, to the whole  world. We have no alternative but to get it right, and we cannot mess it up. A  sound and steady China-U.S. relationship is required for advancing our two  countries' respective development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable  international environment. Our two sides need to increase communication and  cooperation, each manage our domestic affairs well and, at the same time,  shoulder our share of international responsibilities, take China-U.S. relations  forward in a positive direction, and work together to advance the noble cause of  world peace and development. Doing so will advance the interests of our two  peoples and meet the expectation of the international community.President Biden said that how  U.S.-China relations evolve has a profound impact not only on the two countries,  but also on the rest of the world. The two countries have a responsibility to  the world as well as to the two peoples. The two sides must not mess up the  relationship, and the United States has no objective to change China's system.  He noted the need for the two sides to respect each other, have peaceful  coexistence, enhance communication, reduce misunderstandings and handle  differences in a constructive way.Both Presidents expressed  that their opposition to a "new Cold War" and that China and the United States  should not have conflict or confrontation. China rejects a "new Cold  War" in whatever forms. And President Biden has also made it clear at the UN  General Assembly that the United States would not seek a "new Cold War". All  countries, including U.S. allies, are unwilling to return to the old path of  Cold War or to choose sides between China and the United States. At the meeting,  President Xi said that drawing ideological lines or dividing the world into  different camps or rival groups will only make the world suffer. The U.S. side  needs to meet its word of not seeking a "new Cold War" with concrete actions,  and play a constructive and uniting role in the Asia-Pacific. President Biden  noted that the U.S. revitalization of its alliances is not anti-China, and that  the United States' objective is not to have a conflict with China. The immediate  priority is for the two sides to have candid, extensive and substantive  dialogues in this relationship, and make sure that competition between the two  countries is healthy and does not veer into conflict.Q3: Could I assume that  the "one important question" you mentioned in the end must be the Taiwan  question? Tensions are rising again in the cross-Straits relations. This is a  matter of concern for every Chinese. On the Taiwan question, the United States  has repeatedly interfered in China's internal affairs and stepped on China's red  lines, much to the dislike of the Chinese people. A: Promoting national  reunification and safeguarding territorial integrity is the shared will and firm  resolve of all Chinese people. The Taiwan question has always been the most  important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations, and a fixed topic for  every discussion between our Presidents. At this meeting, President Xi Jinping  pointed out that the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint  Communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relationship. Successive  U.S. administrations have made clear commitments on this question. In the UN  General Assembly Resolution 2758 and the three joint communiqués, the true  status quo of the Taiwan question and what lies at the heart of one China have  been articulated in clear-cut terms, i.e. there is but one China in the world  and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of  China is the sole legal government representing China.Achieving China's complete  reunification is an aspiration shared by all sons and daughters of the Chinese  nation. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the  utmost sincerity and efforts. That said, should the separatist forces for Taiwan  independence make provocations, force our hands or even cross the red line, we  will be compelled to take resolute measures. On this question of China's  sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no room for China to back down.President Biden reiterated at the  meeting that the United States abides by the one-China policy and does not  support "Taiwan independence".On the question of Taiwan, I have  a few more words to say. As you said, the Chinese people are very unhappy about  the recent wrongful words and actions by the U.S. side, which were attempts to  misrepresent and obscure the one-China policy. The Chinese government has made  serious representations to the U.S. side for multiple times. The meaning and  connotations of one China are clear, legally and politically. They are reflected  in the three joint communiqués and the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758,  which are official international agreements and documents with legal effect.  They should not be altered, distorted or negated. The UN General Assembly  Resolution 2758 has made it clear that "the representatives of the Government of  the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to  the UN". The Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat, in a number of legal  opinions following the resolution, has also confirmed that "the United Nations  considers 'Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status", and the  "'authorities' in 'Taipei' are not considered to enjoy any form of government  status". The three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqués say in black and white that "The  United States of America recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of  China as the sole legal Government of China, and acknowledges the Chinese  position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China". The United  States should adhere to the official bilateral agreements reached with China and  resolutions adopted with overwhelming majority at the UN General Assembly,  respect the fact that most countries uphold and stand for the one-China  principle. The U.S. side is expected to change its course and take steps to win  the trust of the Chinese people as well as the international community.Q4: The rest of the world  is very concerned about risk management in China-U.S. relations. The United  States has talked about risk management many times, stressing the need for  making the rules of the road or "guardrails" in the bilateral relationship. What  is China's view? The United States is frequently talking about competition with  China. What is China's response?A: President Xi Jinping said that  China is willing to discuss with the U.S. side effective risk management on the  basis of mutual respect. The high levels of the two sides, and the departments  of foreign affairs and national defense, among others, need to keep and increase  communication. That said, it is important to have the resolve to prevent and  avert crises, and remove their root causes. That would bring fundamental  solutions.As for competition, President Xi  Jinping pointed out that cooperation should be priortized. Cooperation may  invovle areas of competition, such as the economic field, but competition must  be fair and healthy, conducive to respective and common development.Let me draw an analogy: putting  out fire is certainly important, but fire prevention is equally important. So,  inflammables and explosives shall be removed whenever they are spotted.Importantly, whether it is making  rules for competition or installing guardrails for a relationship, it should be  done through consultation on equal footing, agreed and adhered to by both sides,  rather than one side imposing conditions or demands on the other.Q5: Since the start of  this year, values have often been made an issue by the U.S. side, and a  "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" will be held before the end of this year. Did  the two sides talk about this summit during the meeting?A: President Xi Jinping said at  the meeting that democracy is not a one-size-fits-all product that has only one  model or configuration for the whole world. Whether a country is democratic or  not should be judged by its own people. Dismissing forms of democracy that are  different from one's own is in itself undemocratic. We are willing to have  dialogues on human rights on the basis of mutual respect, but we oppose using  human rights to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Hong Kong,  Xinjiang, Tibet and maritime issues concern China's sovereignty, territorial  integrity and core interests, and are close to the hearts of the Chinese people.  On these questions, China has no room to back down. The United States should  respect China's interests and concerns, and handle the relevant issues in a  prudent and proper way.Let me also say that China  advocates peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are  common values of humanity. Democracy is not a slogan to be chanted, but requires  concrete actions. The key criteria is whether it benefits the people and has  people's support.Q6: We know that both  Chinese and U.S. Presidents care a lot about climate change. Was this issue  covered at this virtual meeting?A: Climate change is a common  concern of the international community, and an important area of China-U.S.  cooperation. At the meeting, President Xi Jinping recalled China-U.S.  cooperation that brought about the Paris Agreement on climate change. A few days  ago, the two sides issued their second joint declaration about climate change.  As both countries are transitioning to green and low carbon economy, climate  change can well become a new highlight of cooperation.Needless to say, cooperation on  climate change is inseparable from the broader climate of China-U.S. relations,  and thus requires efforts from both sides to foster an enabling atmosphere.  Since last year, China has announced its goals of carbon peak and carbon  neutrality, and then its decision of not building new coal-fired power projects  abroad. This means that China will use the shortest time in history to realize  the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity, a task that will take  extraordinary efforts. China is still the biggest developing country in the  world. All countries need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities, and strike a balance between climate change response and  livelihood protection. What the world needs is less finger-pointing or blame  game, but more solidarity and cooperation. Promises matter, but actions matter  even more. Developed countries need to earnestly fulfill their historical  responsibilities and obligations, and maintain consistency in their policies.Q7: COVID-19 is still  ravaging the world and the world economy is struggling to recover. Mankind faces  multiple crises. Did the two Presidents talk about possibilities of cooperation  to address the crises?A: Emerging from the shadow of  the pandemic, achieving recovery and stability, and overcoming the various risks  and challenges are shared aspirations of the international community. President  Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions China's readiness to work with all  sides in the spirit of solidarity at trying times.At the meeting, President Xi  pointed out that the pandemic once again proves that humanity lives in a  community wih a shared future. There is no higher priority than putting people's  lives first. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapons for the  international community to defeat COVID-19. Response to epidemics must be based  on science. Politicizing health issues does no good but great harm. The pressing  priority in the global COVID response is to address the vaccine deficits and  close the vaccination gap.At the early stage of the  pandemic, China suggested making COVID vaccines a global public good. Recently  we have raised a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative. China is among  the first to offer vaccines to developing countries in need, delivering over 1.7  billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to the world. In the course of this  year, the vaccines we will provide to the international community may exceed two  billion doses. On top of its US$100 million donation to COVAX, China has  announced a donation of another 100 million doses of COVID vaccines to  developing countries within this year. And we will consider making additional  donations in light of the needs of developing countries, the least developed  ones in particular.To get better prepared in the  future, China and the United States should advocate the establishment of a  cooperation mechanism for global public health and communicable disease  prevention and control, and step up prevention against communicable diseases  such as influenza. The two countries may also conduct exchanges and cooperation  in areas such as the monitoring of COVID pandemic, research on scientific  bottlenecks, disease prevention and treatment, and vaccination.Q8: Did the two  Presidents discuss regional and international hot spot issues at the  meeting?A: The two Presidents exchanged  views on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue and  Afghanistan, among other regional and international issues of mutual interest.  President Xi pointed out that China and the United States need to uphold the  international system with the United Nations at its center, the international  order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international  relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. A  multilateralism without China-U.S. cooperation or the participation of either  would be incomplete and unrealistic.I wish to stress here that China  is willing to enhance cooperation on the relevant issues on the basis of mutual  respect, equality and mutual benefit. China will continue to play a positive  role on the relevant issues and make its own efforts. At the same time, we call  upon the U.S. side to play a constructive role, actively respond to, take  seriously and address reasonable concerns of parties concerned, and shoulder its  due responsibilities and obligations.Q9: You said that the two  Presidents also exchanged views on the domestic development agenda. In China, we  have just had the sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, a big  event that has drawn a lot of attention. Did the two Presidents talk about  this?A: At the meeting, President Xi  shared with President Biden, in the context of the sixth Plenum, the major  accomplishments and historical experience of the CPC in the past 100 years.  President Xi said that over the past centenary, the CPC has kept to its founding  aspiration and mission, namely to strive for the happiness of the Chinese people  and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We have accomplished a lot in that  direction, and we will continue to do more. Our people's aspiration for a better  life is what the Party strives for. "Serving the 1.4 billion Chinese people and  working with them for a better life is my great honor and a great  responsibility, and I shall put aside my own well-being and live up to people's  expectations," said President Xi. Our people's aspiration for a better life is  the biggest internal driver for China's development and an inevitable trend of  history. Any attempt to stop this historical trend will be rejected by the  Chinese people, and will by no means succeed.President Xi also reiterated  China's unwavering determination to open wider at a high standard, to share  development opportunities with the rest of the world, and to make economic  globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. China is  talking about a new development paradigm for the purpose of expanding domestic  market, fostering a combination of domestic and international circulations with  greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more  market-oriented, law-based and up to international standard. All this will  provide a bigger market and greater opportunities to the United States and other  countries.Q10: How will this  meeting shape the future of China-U.S. relations? Do both sides have any  arrangement for the two Presidents to meet in person sometime in  future?A: This meeting, held at a  crucial moment, is an occasion for the two Presidents to once again set the  direction for this relationship and will have significant and far-reaching  impact for China-U.S. relations. President Xi and President Biden agreed to keep  in touch by multiple means. We are open to all forms of communication between  the two Presidents, including an in-person meeting. We will let things take  their natural course. What matters is to move in the same direction and foster a  favorable atmosphere for the meeting to generate good outcomes.If the China-U.S. relationship  can not go back to what it was in the past, then it must move toward the future.  China has no illusion. But we have confidence, and will continue to stay the  course. We are open to all options that can take this relationship forward. That  said, we also have our principles, in short, the three principles put forward by  President Xi Jinping today: mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win  cooperation.The China-U.S.relationship stands  at a crossroads. We hope that the United States will work with China, follow the  spirit of the two Presidents' meeting with concrete actions, maintain dialogue  and communication, strengthen exchanges and cooperation and manage differences  in a responsible way, so as to promote sound and stable development of  China-U.S. relationship.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 28th APEC Economic Leaders’Meeting12 November 2021The Right Honorable Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern,Dear Colleagues,It is a great pleasure to meet you online. First of all, let me thank Prime Minister Ardern and the New Zealand government for their hard work in putting this meeting together. This session has chosen its theme to be “Recovering from COVID-19 to Build Prosperity for All Our People and Future Generations”, which is of great significance.This year marks the 30th anniversary of China’s joining of APEC.It has been three decades of deepening reform and opening-up for China, and of broadening economic cooperation across the Asia-Pacific. Indeed, the Asia-Pacific region has become the most dynamic and promising economic powerhouse globally, staying at the forefront of world economic development, and making its positive contribution to global growth and to the well-being of people in the region.Last year, building on the progress toward the Bogor Goals, we adopted the Putrajaya Vision 2040, reaffirming our original aspiration of bettering the lives of our people and envisioning an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community. This year, we have jointly formulated its implementation plan. We shall keep up our good work to put the Vision into action, and endeavor to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future featuring openness and inclusiveness, innovation-driven growth, greater connectivity, and mutually beneficial cooperation. To that end, I propose we focus our efforts on the following directions.First, advance anti-COVID cooperation and promote economic recovery. As we meet, the pandemic continues to pose a grave challenge and global economic recovery remains fragile and difficult. To defeat the pandemic and restore growth at an early date is a first-order priority for APEC economies at the moment. We need to follow a science-based approach in pandemic response, deepen international cooperation, promote the research, development, production and fair distribution of vaccines, ensure their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, and close the immunization gap. China has announced that it would provide a total of two billion doses of vaccines to the world in the course of this year, and has so far provided over 1.7 billion doses, including donations to more than 110 countries. At the recent 16th G20 Summit, I proposed, on China’s behalf, a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative. China has undertaken to offer three billion US dollars over the next three years to support COVID-19 response and economic and social recovery in fellow developing countries. China welcomes APEC initiatives to facilitate the movement of essential goods and people in a safe manner, and will continue to provide support to the Sub-Fund for APEC Cooperation on Combating COVID-19 and Economic Recovery with a view to helping member economies recover and growthe economy.Second, foster an open Asia-Pacific economy. Openness is the lifeline of Asia-Pacific cooperation. We need touphold open regionalism, follow theguidance of the APEC Vision 2040 in advancing regional economic integration, and work for the early realization of a high-standard Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). We need to practice true multilateralism, stick to dialogue rather than confrontation, inclusiveness rather than exclusion, and integration rather than decoupling, and be resolute in safeguarding the multilateral trading regime with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. China supports the implementation of the Enhanced APEC Agenda for Structural Reform and the APEC Services Competitiveness Roadmap. We look forward to the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) on schedule next year, and we have applied for joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).Third, promote innovation-driven development and the digital economy. Innovation is an important driving force that propels world development. We need to commit ourselves to innovation-driven development, harness the power of the digital economy as a new growth engine, and spread the fruits of digital technologies to more people in our region. We need to implement the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap in a full and balanced manner, andfoster an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for innovation and the growth of productivity. We need to further developthe digital infrastructure, speed up digital transformation, strive to bridge the digital divide, and promote development of the digital economy in an all-round way. China has put forward the initiative of Enhancing Implementation of APEC Connectivity Blueprint (2015-2025) in the Digital Era.We support stronger international cooperation on the digital economy, and have applied to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).Fourth, pursue inclusive and sustainable development. We need to seek the harmonious coexistence between man and nature, actively respond to climate change, promote green and low-carbon transition, and foster a community of all life on Earth. China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and supports developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energies. And China will work with partner countries to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We need to fully implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and let the gains of development benefit more people across the world in a more equitable way. At this year’s UN General Assembly in September, I put forward a Global Development Initiative that aims at steering global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth. The Initiative also holds great significance for sustainable development of the Asia-Pacific region. Economic and technical cooperation is an important area of APECcooperation. We need to step up input, make sure that developing members get real benefit from such cooperation, and keep injecting new dynamism into the development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific.Colleagues,This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC). It is the CPC’s unchanginggoal to deliver a better life for the over 1.4 billion Chinese people and to promote peace and development for humanity. Now, China has started a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. China will unswervingly expand opening-up, and share its development opportunities with APEC members and the wider world.There is a Maori proverb in New Zealand that says, “Success is not ever that of an individual, but always that of a collective.” China will workwith all APEC membersin building an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and jointly opening a new chapter for Asia-Pacific economic cooperation.Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of China At the APEC CEO Summit11 November 2021Leaders of the Business Community,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,I am very glad to meet you again. At present, COVID-19 is still ravaging the world, and the journey to global economic recovery remains a difficult and tortuous one. The Asia-Pacific has all along been an important engine driving the global economy. Indeed, it is among the first to regain the momentum of recovery in this crisis. At this historical juncture, it is important that we in the Asia-Pacific face up to the responsibility of the times, be in the driver’s seat, and strive hard to meet the goal of building an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future.First, we need to make all-out efforts to fight COVID-19. To emerge from the shadow of the pandemic and achieve steady economic recovery at an early date is the most pressing task for us in the Asia-Pacific. At this trying time, it is all the more important that we should stay confident, keep a steady hand on the tiller, and forge ahead with determination. Over the past decades, we in the Asia-Pacific have been able to make advances by overcoming crises and achieve success by meeting challenges. In the face of this once-in-a-century test that is crucial to the future of humanity, we the Asia-Pacific economies as well as various sectors should put our people and their lives first, follow the guidance of science, pull together with solidarity, extend assistance to each other, and fight to beat the pandemic.We should support each other in fighting COVID-19 and step up cooperation in areas such as testing methods, treatment medicine and the research, development, production and mutual recognition of vaccines to truly create synergy against COVID-19. We should translate the consensus that vaccines are a global public good into concrete actions, ensure their fair and equitable distribution as well as their accessibility and affordability in developing countries, and thus work together to close the immunization gap.Second, we need to uphold openness and cooperation. Openness is the sure way for realizing human prosperity and progress. Over the past 30-plus years, thanks to our concerted efforts such as the adoption of the Bogor Goals and the Putrajaya Vision as well as macroeconomic policy coordination and the building of high-standard free trade areas, we in the Asia-Pacific have succeeded in sustaining fast development for a fairly long period of time. Ultimately, this has become possible because we have endeavored to create an open economic architecture and forge an Asia-Pacific partnership based on mutual trust, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation.No matter how global developments may evolve, the Asia-Pacific economy will keep its strengths of being resilient and robust. We should all be broad-minded, follow the underlying trend of the times and proactively expand opening-up. We should advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, keep industrial and supply chains stable and functioning, and promote the orderly flow of resources and inputs to boost economic recovery and achieve interconnected development. We should be forward-looking, move ahead and reject practices of discrimination and exclusion of others. Attempts to draw ideological lines or form small circles on geopolitical grounds are bound to fail. The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era.Third, we need to promote green transition. A sound eco-environment is the most basic public good that benefits all. We in the Asia-Pacific should make its post-pandemic recovery a green one and take the lead in making a science-based response to climate change. We need to follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and deliver on what was agreed upon in the Paris Agreement on climate change and at the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Developed economies should act on a sense of being in the same community with other economies, provide developing economies with funding and technological support and help them enhance their capacity to conduct environmental governance. Working together, all of us can embark on a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.Green and low-carbon transition is a systemic project that must be pursued across the board and in a coordinated way. In the Asia-Pacific, over 100 million people still live in abject poverty. Some economies are still plagued by inadequate infrastructure development, education and health care, and they are weak in food security and energy supply. Without development, it will be impossible to pool the economic strength necessary for achieving green transition. Neglecting people’s livelihood means loss of social support for pursuing green transition. We need to gain an accurate understanding of what sustainable development means, put the people first, and strike a balance between economic growth, ensuring people’s well-being, and energy conservation and emissions reduction. This will enable us to catalyze green transition in the course of economic development and achieve greater development through green transition.Fourth, we need to actively promote innovation. Innovation is an important force driving human progress. I have often stressed that a country or region cannot prosper without innovation or even with slow innovation. The Asia-Pacific has distinctive intellectual resources and a long tradition of innovation. Having created many new technologies, new industries and new mechanisms, this region of ours has always been a global pacesetter of innovation-driven development. Today, a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is well underway, and information technology, biotechnology and manufacturing technology are developing rapidly. This has positioned us well to promote economic growth and respond to challenges such as major diseases, climate change and natural disasters.We need to speed up scientific and technological innovation and institutional innovation, promote the commercialization of scientific and technological advances, and foster new drivers of growth so that innovation will boost both economic development and green transition. We need to scale up cooperation between member economies of the Asia-Pacific on scientific and technological innovation, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology. The business community, standing at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation, should strive to be a major force of increasing input in research and development and applying research outcomes.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Over the years, China’s economic development has been an integral part of the Asia-Pacific cooperation process. China has attained the goal of fully building a moderately prosperous society within the set time frame, secured a historic success in eradicating absolute poverty, and embarked on a new journey toward fully building itself into a modern socialist country. This will create greater opportunities for our region.— China will remain firm in advancing reform and opening-up so as to add impetus to economic development in the Asia-Pacific. China is committed to building a high-standard market system and will work to make new progress in reforming important areas and key links. China will pursue high-standard institutional opening-up, continue to improve its business environment, and promote innovation-driven development of pilot free trade zones. China has ratified the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and it has applied for joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In the course of RCEP implementation and CPTPP negotiation, China will continue to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, promote all-round opening-up of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, expand the opening of the service sector, and treat domestic and foreign businesses as equals in accordance with law. As a Chinese saying goes, “To get things right at the end, one needs to lay a sound foundation; to achieve a good result, one needs to be prudent from the start.” Recently, the competent Chinese government departments are improving and better enforcing anti-monopoly laws and regulations, and strengthening regulation over some sectors. This is called for to promote the sound development of the market economy in China. As a matter of fact, it is also a common practice in other countries. We will unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector, and unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector. We treat all types of market entities on an equal basis, and we are working to develop a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system. This will enable us to cement the foundation for long-term development of the Chinese economy and better support businesses from both the Asia-Pacific and the wider world in investing and operating in China.— China will advance green transition on all fronts and make its due contribution to boosting ecological conservation in the Asia-Pacific and beyond. For many years, I used to live in a small village on the Loess Plateau, at a time when its eco-environment was undermined and its people were poverty-stricken. It had come to me that harms done to nature will eventually harm ourselves. China will actively promote ecological conservation. To us, lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. We will intensify comprehensive efforts to stem soil erosion and win the critical battle of pollution prevention and control. China will fully implement its national strategy on climate change response. Since I announced the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality last year, China has formulated an Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030, and moved faster to put in place a “1+N” policy framework. Here, “1” stands for the guiding principle and top-level design for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, and “N” refers to implementation plans for key areas and industries, including the action for green energy transition, the action for peaking carbon dioxide emissions in the industrial sector, the action for promoting green and low-carbon transportation, and the action for promoting circular economy for decarbonization purposes. China will strike a balance between low-carbon transition and ensuring the living needs of its people, and between development and carbon reduction, and will achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality within the time frame we set.  China’s carbon reduction action is a profound economic and social transformation. However formidable the task may be, we will work tirelessly to make our contribution to promoting global green transition. Our carbon reduction action will also require massive investment, thus creating huge market opportunities and room for cooperation. The business communities across the Asia-Pacific are warmly welcome to join us in this endeavor. Together, we can usher in a future of green development. — China will stay committed to promoting win-win cooperation and contribute to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific. China has all along been actively involved in regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific, and it has endeavored to advance openness and cooperation in the region. China will continue to practice true multilateralism, uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, take an active part in global economic governance and promote the building of an open world economy. China will steadfastly advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, facilitate connectivity in the Asia-Pacific, ensure stable and smooth functioning of industrial and supply chains in the region, and deepen cooperation with all stakeholders in such areas as e-commerce and digital logistics. With these efforts, we can inject impetus into economic recovery and sustainable development in our region.  At this year’s United Nations General Assembly, I proposed a Global Development Initiative, calling for meeting the development needs of developing countries, ensuring their development opportunities and thus achieving a more robust, greener and more balanced global development. China will continue playing its role as a responsible major country. It will promote closer cooperation in areas such as global poverty reduction, food security and development financing, and earnestly implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, thus building a global community of development with a shared future.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,Over the years, as business leaders, you have witnessed and participated in China’s development. I hope that you will continue to take a keen interest in and support China’s development, and achieve win-win in our cooperation. Working together, let us all be promoters of and contributors to unity and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific family.  Thank you all. 
                

                Remarks by State Councilor Wang YiAt the Opening Ceremony of the Symposium on Global MaritimeCooperation and Ocean Governance 2021Distinguished Guests,Friends,It gives me great pleasure toattend the opening ceremony of the Symposium on Global Maritime Cooperation and Ocean Governance 2021. Let me begin by expressing my warm congratulations to the Symposium and extending a hearty welcome to the participating dignitaries, officials, experts, scholars, and friends from the media!The ocean is a cradle of life, a bond connecting nations around the world, and an important platform for globalization. In recent years, maritime security issues are emerging one after another, the marine ecosystem is worsening, and global ocean governance is confronted with myriads of challenges. None of them can be resolved by any individual country. It takes solidarity and cooperation of the entire international community to address them.President Xi Jinping has put forward an important vision of building a maritime community with a shared future, thus illuminating from a new perspective the relationship of harmonious coexistence between man andocean, andpointing the way forward for the cause of global maritime development. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic and the major changes unseen in a centuryhave together brought about complex and grave economic and security challenges, and countries areseeing their future connected more than ever before. Mankind should not be split into isolated islands or blocs by oceans. Instead, we should make the ocean a bond for stronger solidarity and jointly build a maritime community with a shared future. To this end, I propose that we make the following efforts:We need to stay committed to multilateralism and jointly safeguard the maritime order. Oceans and continents coexist in harmony, and this relationship should not be replaced by zero-sum rivalry between maritime power and land power. The ocean should no longer be used as a tool for unilateralpower politics in the world. In the globalized world today, multilateralism is an important basis for safeguarding peace. We opposethe maritime hegemony-seeking moves by certain countries to flex muscles, gangup to form exclusive blocs, and continuously infringe upon the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of other countries. The world should get united, hold high the banner of multilateralism, defend the UN-centered international system, and uphold the maritime order underpinned by international law.We need to stay committed to dialogue and consultation and jointly promote peace of the ocean. Peace of the ocean is more precious than gold. For thousands of years, the Chinese have used the ocean to promote friendship, but never used it for aggression or expansion. Since the founding of New China, we always respect the legitimate pursuit of maritime interests by all others, workto narrow differences through dialogue, and strive to resolve disputes through negotiation. On the South China Sea, China and ASEAN countries are committed to the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and we are steadily making new progress in the consultation on the code of conduct(COC). We will soon host a special China-ASEAN summit in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of dialogue relations andnext year, we will mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the DOC. China and ASEAN countries should seize this opportunity to strive for the early conclusion of the COC, and make the South China Sea a sea of peace, a sea of friendship, and a sea of cooperation.We need to stay committed to openness and inclusiveness and jointly deepen maritime cooperation. The ocean is an artery for international industrial and supply chains. The recent problems in the global supply chainsare due to not only the objective reason of the pandemic, but also man-made factors such as unilateralism and protectionism. We need to uphold the principle of shared benefits and shared governance, strengthen maritime connectivity, and promote free trade. We need to maintain stable and unimpeded marine transportation and industrial chains, and build an open global economy at a higher level with an open and connected ocean. China will work with all countries to fully implement the Global Development Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping. We hope that, through building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and jointly promoting the Partnership for Blue Economy, we will boost maritime connectivity at a faster pace, build platforms for maritime cooperation, and inject new vitality into global economic recovery.We need to stay committed to green development and jointly protect the marine environment. The ocean is the common homeland for all countries. We must take care of the ocean and protect it as we do with our lives. We need to make sure that everything we do is in the interest of the long-term development and progress of humanity. We need to develop and utilize marine resources in an orderly manner, join hands in tackling global challenges such as climate warming and rising sea levels, and deal with conducts that damage the marine environment such as the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water in strict accordance with law, so as to ensure that our blue planet retains its primary color forever, and that our future generations continue to enjoy clean ocean and blue skies. China attaches great importance to promoting marine ecological civilization, and is making sustained efforts to strengthen the prevention and control of marine pollution, protect marine biodiversity, and promote the orderly development and utilization of marine resources. China also stands ready to deepen cooperation with all countries on these fronts to contribute to the green development of the ocean.Friends,The 21st century is a century of the ocean. China is ready to work with all countries to build a maritime community with a shared future, so that the ocean can always be a beautiful homeland for humanity to live and thrive. I look forward to your in-depth dialogue and exchanges on important topics of maritime cooperation and governance. To conclude, I wish this forum a full success.Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony ofThe Fourth China International Import Expo4 November 2021Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,Your Excellencies Heads of International Organizations,Your Excellencies Heads of Delegations,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Good evening! As the fourth China International Import Expo (CIIE) opens today, it gives me great pleasure to meet you online in this cloud meeting. At the outset, I would like to extend, on behalf of the government and people of China and also in my own name, a hearty welcome to our distinguished guests and warm greetings and best wishes to our friends old and new.China is a firm believer in honoring its words with actions. The measures I announced at the third CIIE for further opening up have mostly been implemented. The negative list for cross-border trade in services at the Hainan Free Trade Port has been introduced; reform and innovation for pilot free trade zones are making steady progress; foreign investment access continues to expand; business environment continues to improve; negotiations on the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment have been concluded; and China is among the first to have completed domestic ratification of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China has overcome the impact of COVID-19 to achieve innovative growth in foreign trade. As the only major economy to register positive growth of trade in goods last year, China has made important contributions to keeping global industrial and supply chains stable and boosting world economic recovery.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,As we speak, the world is experiencing the combined impacts of major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, and economic globalization is facing headwinds. Studies show a steady decline of the World Openness Index over the past decade and a weakening of global consensus on opening up, which are causes for great concern. For a boat to sail upstream, it has to forge ahead or be driven backward. We must stay on top of the prevailing trend of economic globalization, and support countries around the world in opening up wider while rejecting unilateralism and protectionism. This is significantly important if we are to take humanity to a better future.Opening up is the hallmark of contemporary China. This year marks the 20th anniversary of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Over the last two decades, China has fully delivered on its accession commitments. Its overall tariff rate has been cut from 15.3 percent to 7.4 percent, lower than the 9.8 percent accession commitment. The central government has reviewed and revised over 2,300 pieces of laws and regulations, and local governments over 190,000 pieces, which all helped to unleash market and social vitality. Since the start of COVID-19, China has provided to the international community some 350 billion masks, over four billion protective suits, over six billion testing kits, and over 1.6 billion doses of vaccines. China has actively promoted international cooperation against the pandemic, and supported waiving intellectual property rights on vaccines for developing countries. These are the concrete actions China has taken to honor commitments and fulfill responsibilities.Over the last 20 years, China’s economic size has grown from the 6th to the 2nd largest in the world, trade in goods from the 6th to the 1st, and trade in services from the 11th to the 2nd. China has led developing countries in utilized foreign investment, and its outbound direct investment (ODI) has risen from the 26th to the 1st. The past 20 years have witnessed a China deepening reform and pursuing all-round opening up, a China seizing opportunities and rising to challenges, and a China stepping up to its responsibilities and benefiting the whole world.   Since joining the WTO, China has kept opening wider to the world, thus generating a new wave of domestic development while injecting fresh impetus into the world economy.China’s development and progress since its WTO accession 20 years ago is the result of much hard work and great tenacity of the Chinese people under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). It is also the result of China’s proactive steps to strengthen international cooperation and pursue win-win cooperation.On this occasion, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to all Chinese and foreign friends from different social sectors for taking part in and witnessing this historic process and for supporting China’s opening up and development endeavor.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Ancient Chinese observed, “One can tell the inside of a thing by observing its outside and see the future development by reviewing the past.” For any country or nation to thrive, it must follow the logic of history and develop in line with the trend of the times. As for China, we will not change our resolve to open wider at a high standard; we will not change our determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world; and we will not change our commitment to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.First, China will firmly safeguard true multilateralism. The multilateral trading regime with the WTO at its core is the cornerstone of international trade. Right now, the multilateral trading regime faces challenges. China supports the WTO reform in moving in the right direction. We support the inclusive development of the multilateral trading regime, as well as the legitimate rights and interests of the developing members. China will take an active and open attitude in negotiations on issues such as the digital economy, trade and the environment, industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises, uphold the position of the multilateral trading regime as the main channel for international rules-setting, and safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains.Second, China will firmly share market opportunities with the rest of the world. China has a population of over 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of more than 400 million people. Our annual import in goods and services is valued at around US$2.5 trillion. All this offers an enormous market. Going forward, China will lay more emphasis on expanding import, and pursue balanced development of trade. China will open more demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade, optimize the catalogue of retail imports via cross-border e-commerce, encourage the on-site processing of imported goods from trading between border residents, and increase imports from neighboring countries. China will better integrate its domestic and foreign trade, speed up the development of international consumption center cities, promote Silk Road e-commerce, build modern logistics systems, and shore up the capacity of cross-border logistics.Third, China will firmly promote high-standard opening up. China will further shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and expand the opening of telecommunication, healthcare and other services in an orderly fashion. China will revise and enlarge the encouraged industry catalogue to guide more foreign investment toward sectors such as advanced manufacturing, modern services, high and new technology, energy conservation and environmental protection, and toward the central, western and northeastern regions. China will conduct stress tests for high-standard opening up in pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port, and will release a negative list for cross-border trade in services in the pilot free trade zones. China will deeply engage in international cooperation on green and low-carbon development and the digital economy, and work actively for joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).Fourth, China will firmly uphold the common interests of the world. China will take an active part in cooperation within the United Nations, the WTO, the G20, APEC, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other institutions, and promote more discussions on such issues as trade and investment, the digital economy, and green and low-carbon development. China will support the fair distribution of and unimpeded trade in vaccines and other key medical supplies across the world. China will promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation so that more countries and peoples will benefit from its development opportunities and real outcomes. China will actively join in global efforts to tackle climate change and safeguard food and energy security, and provide more assistance to fellow developing countries within the framework of South-South cooperation.  Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,As a Chinese proverb reads, “The going may be tough when one walks alone, but it gets easier when people walk together.” As the pandemic continues to wreak havoc and the global economy faces a bumpy recovery, it is all the more imperative that people around the world pull together to tide over this difficult time. China stands ready to work with all countries to build an open world economy so that the spring breeze of openness will bring warmth to all parts of the world.Thank you.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders' Summit30 October 2021Your Excellency Prime Minister Mario Draghi,Dear Colleagues,I wish to begin by sincerely thanking Italy, the G20 President, for the great efforts it has made in hosting this Summit.The city of Rome, with its time-honored history, has left a splendid chapter in the history of human civilization. Today, we are meeting here against the backdrop of a protracted COVID-19 pandemic, fragile economic recovery, acute challenges of climate change, and frequent flare-ups of regional hotspot issues. With People, Planet, Prosperity as its theme, the Rome Summit gives expression to the resolve of the international community to act in solidarity to defeat the pandemic and revive the world economy, and demonstrates the mission of the G20 to lead the transformation of global economic governance.Faced with changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, the G20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, needs to shoulder its due responsibilities, bear in mind the future of humanity and the welfare of the people, uphold openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, practice true multilateralism, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. To be specific, I would like to suggest that we work in the following five areas.First, work in solidarity to combat COVID-19. With the coronavirus ravaging the whole world, none of us can stay safe on our own. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapon. The international community must work in concert to confront and defeat the pandemic with a science-based approach. Stigmatization of the virus and politicization of origins tracing run counter to the spirit of solidarity against the pandemic. We need to step up cooperation on prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment, and enhance preparedness for major public health emergencies. The G20 includes the world's major economies and should therefore play a leading role in building consensus, mobilizing resources, and promoting cooperation.At the early stage of the pandemic, I called for COVID-19 vaccines to be made a global public good. On that basis, I would like to propose here a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative: First, we need to strengthen vaccine R&D cooperation and support vaccine companies in conducting joint R&D and production with developing countries. Second, we need to uphold equity and justice, and provide more vaccines to developing countries to meet the global vaccination target for 2022 as set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Third, we need to support the World Trade Organization (WTO) in making an early decision on waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and encourage vaccine companies to transfer technology to developing countries. Fourth, we need to scale up cross-border trade cooperation to ensure smooth trade in vaccines and related raw and auxiliary materials. Fifth, we need to treat different vaccines equally and advance mutual recognition of vaccines in accordance with the WHO's Emergency Use Listing. Sixth, we need to provide financial support for global vaccine cooperation, especially for developing countries to access vaccines.To date, China has provided over 1.6 billion doses of vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organizations, and will provide over two billion doses to the world in the course of this year. China is conducting joint vaccine production with 16 countries, with an initial capacity of 700 million doses per year. The International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation that I proposed last May at the Global Health Summit was held successfully in August. The participating countries reached intended deals of over 1.5 billion doses for this year. China, together with 30 other countries, has also launched an Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation, calling on the international community to promote fair distribution of vaccines around the world. China is ready to work with all parties to enhance vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries and make positive contribution to building a global line of defense through vaccination.Second, strengthen coordination to promote recovery. COVID-19 has made a complex and far-reaching impact on the world economy. It is imperative that we apply the right prescriptions to address both symptoms and root causes of the problems we face. We should step up macroeconomic policy coordination and ensure the continuity, consistency and sustainability of our policies. Major economies should adopt responsible macroeconomic policies, prevent measures taken for themselves from entailing rising inflation, exchange rate fluctuations or mounting debts, avoid negative spillovers on developing countries, and ensure sound operation of the international economic and financial system.At the same time, we should take a long-term perspective, improve the global economic governance system and rules, and make up for the relevant governance deficit. We should continue to push for the scheduled conclusion of the 16th General Quota Review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to buttress the global financial safety net. China supports the early launch of negotiations on the 20th replenishment process of the International Development Association, and maintains that the relevant Voting Rights Review should faithfully reflect the changes in the international economic landscape and raise the voice of developing countries. China welcomes the IMF's decision on the new allocation of Special Drawing Rights totaling 650 billion US dollars, and stands ready to lend the new allocation to low-income countries that are seriously affected by COVID-19.We should safeguard the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and build an open world economy. The G20 should continue to provide political guidance on the reform of the WTO, uphold its core values and basic principles, and protect developing countries' rights, interests and development space. It is imperative to restore, as quickly as possible, the normal operation of the dispute settlement mechanism, and work for positive results at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference. We should keep the industrial and supply chains safe and stable, and ensure the smooth functioning of the world economy. China proposes to hold an international forum on resilient and stable industrial and supply chains, and welcomes the active participation of G20 members and relevant international organizations.Infrastructure development plays an important role in propelling economic growth. China has made unremitting efforts in this regard through Belt and Road cooperation and other initiatives. China is prepared to work with all sides to uphold the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, stay committed to the vision of open, green and clean cooperation, and pursue the goal of high-standard, people-centered and sustainable development, so as to deliver more fruitful outcomes from high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.Third, embrace inclusiveness to achieve common development. The pandemic has brought multiple crises to the world, developing countries in particular. The number of people living in hunger has reached around 800 million. Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is facing unprecedented challenges. In this context, we must take a people-centered approach and make global development more equitable, effective and inclusive, so that no country will be left behind.The G20 should prioritize development in macro policy coordination, ensure sound implementation of the Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, move forward with the Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and Least Developed Countries, and promote synergy among the existing mechanisms for development cooperation. Advanced economies should fulfill their pledges on official development assistance (ODA) and provide more resources for developing countries.Not long ago, I proposed a Global Development Initiative at the United Nations and called on the international community to strengthen cooperation in areas of poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, so as to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development. This initiative is highly compatible with the G20's goal and priority of promoting global development. We welcome the active participation of more countries in the initiative.Fourth, pursue innovation to tap growth potential. Innovation is a decisive factor in promoting economic and social development and in addressing the common challenges to humanity. The G20 should join forces to unleash the potential for innovation-driven growth and draw up rules based on extensive participation and broad-based consensus to foster an enabling environment for innovation-driven development. Forming exclusive blocs or even drawing ideological lines will only cause division and create more obstacles, which will do no good but only harm to scientific and technological innovation.Digital economy is an important frontier of scientific and technological innovation. The G20 should shoulder responsibilities in the digital era, quicken the development of new types of digital infrastructure, promote deeper integration of digital technologies with the real economy, and help developing countries eliminate the digital divide. China has put forth the Global Initiative on Data Security. We may discuss and develop international rules for digital governance that reflect the will and respect the interests of all sides, and actively foster an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for digital development. China attaches great importance to international cooperation on digital economy, and has decided to apply to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. China stands ready to work with all parties for the healthy and orderly development of digital economy.Fifth, promote harmonious co-existence to achieve green and sustainable development. The G20 needs to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, push for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and support a successful COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Developed countries need to lead by example on emissions reduction, fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments of climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries. This is critically important for the success of the upcoming COP26.China has all along undertaken due international responsibilities commensurate with its national conditions. We have actively advanced the green transition of our economy, and raised the ambition of our climate actions on our own initiative. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity. The construction of the first batch of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of about 100 million kilowatts was launched in an orderly fashion. China will strive to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We will honor our words with actions and work with all countries to pursue a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.Colleagues,As an ancient Chinese philosopher observed, "He who has credibility connects the world." In other words, credibility is the foundation for interactions with the world. China will stay committed to the fundamental state policy of opening-up to unleash the potential of its huge market and enormous domestic demand. We will promote institutional opening-up that covers rules, regulations, management and standards, and step up protection of intellectual property rights. We will continue to foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards, and ensure a fair and equitable market order for both domestic and foreign companies. I am convinced that China's development will bring even greater and new opportunities to the world and inject still more new impetus to the world economy.As the saying goes, Rome wasn't built in a day. To build a community with a shared future for mankind requires persisting efforts of all countries. Although the journey ahead may be long and arduous, with sustained actions, we will eventually reach our destination and embrace a brighter future. Let us work together to dispel the dark clouds of the pandemic at an early date and jointly build an ever better future for all of us!Thank you.
                

                25 October 2021Your Excellency Secretary-General António Guterres,Your Excellencies Diplomatic Envoys and Representatives of International Organizations,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Comrades,Fifty years ago today, the 26th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, and the decision was made to restore all rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. It was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people of the world.Today, on this special date, we are here to review the past history and look to the future, and that makes our gathering all the more significant.The restoration of New China's lawful seat in the United Nations was a momentous event for the world and the United Nations. It came as the result of joint efforts of all peace-loving countries that stood up for justice in the world. It marked the return of the Chinese people, or one-fourth of the world's population, back to the UN stage. The importance was significant and far-reaching for both China and the wider world.On this occasion, I wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, heartfelt gratitude to all countries that co-sponsored and supported UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and to pay high tribute to all countries and people that stand on the side of justice.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Comrades,The past five decades since New China restored its lawful seat in the United Nations have witnessed China's peaceful development and its commitment and dedication to the welfare of all humanity.- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have demonstrated an untiring spirit and kept to the right direction of China's development amidst changing circumstances, thus writing an epic chapter in the development of China and humanity. Building on achievements in national construction and development since the founding of New China, the Chinese people have started the new historical era of reform and opening-up, and successfully initiated and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have continued to unleash and develop productivity and raise living standards, and achieved a historic breakthrough of leaping from a country with relatively low productivity to the second largest economy in the world. Through much hard work, the Chinese people have attained the goal of fully building a moderately prosperous society on the vast land of China, and won the battle against poverty, thus securing a historic success in eradicating absolute poverty. We have now embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country and opened up bright prospects for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have stood in solidarity and cooperation with people around the world and upheld international equity and justice, contributing significantly to world peace and development. The Chinese people are peace-loving people and know well the value of peace and stability. We have unswervingly followed an independent foreign policy of peace, stood firm for fairness and justice, and resolutely opposed hegemony and power politics. The Chinese people are a strong supporter of other developing countries in their just struggle to safeguard sovereignty, security and development interests. The Chinese people are committed to achieving common development. From the Tazara Railway to the Belt and Road Initiative, we have done what we could to help other developing countries, and have offered the world new opportunities through our own development. During the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been active in sharing COVID response experience with the world, and has sent large quantities of supplies, vaccines and medicines to other countries, and deeply engaged in science-based cooperation on COVID-19 origins tracing, all in a sincere and proactive effort to contribute to humanity's final victory over the pandemic.- For these 50 years, the Chinese people have upheld the authority and sanctity of the United Nations and practiced multilateralism, and China's cooperation with the United Nations has deepened steadily. China has faithfully fulfilled its responsibility and mission as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, stayed true to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upheld the central role of the United Nations in international affairs. China has stood actively for political settlement of disputes through peaceful means. It has sent over 50,000 peacekeepers to UN peacekeeping operations, and is now the second largest financial contributor to both the United Nations and UN peacekeeping operations. China has been among the first of countries to meet the UN Millennium Development Goals. It has taken the lead in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, accounting for over 70 percent of global poverty reduction. China has acted by the spirit of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and earnestly applied the universality of human rights in the Chinese context. It has blazed a path of human rights development that is consistent with the trend of the times and carries distinct Chinese features, thus making major contribution to human rights progress in China and the international human rights cause.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Comrades,The trend of the world, vast and mighty, prospers those who follow it and perishes those who go against it. Over the last 50 years, for all the vicissitudes in the international landscape, the world has remained stable as a whole, thanks to the concerted efforts of people of all countries. The world economy has grown rapidly, and innovation in science and technology has kept breaking new ground. A large number of developing countries have grown stronger, over a billion people have walked out of poverty, and a population of several billion are moving toward modernization.In the world today, changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and the force for peace, development and progress has continued to grow. It falls upon us to follow the prevailing trend of history, and choose cooperation over confrontation, openness over seclusion, and mutual benefit over zero-sum games. We shall be firm in opposing all forms of hegemony and power politics, as well as all forms of unilateralism and protectionism.- We should vigorously advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and work together to provide the right guiding philosophy for building a better world. Peace and development are our common cause, equity and justice our common aspiration, and democracy and freedom our common pursuit. The world we live in is diverse and colorful. Diversity makes human civilization what it is, and provides a constant source of vitality and driving force for world development. As a Chinese saying goes, "Without achieving the good of one hundred various schools, the uniqueness of one individual cannot be achieved." No civilization in the world is superior to others; every civilization is special and unique to its own region. Civilizations can achieve harmony only through communication, and can make progress only through harmonization. Whether a country's path of development works is judged, first and foremost, by whether it fits the country's conditions; whether it follows the development trend of the times; whether it brings about economic growth, social advancement, better livelihoods and social stability; whether it has the people's endorsement and support; and whether it contributes to the progressive cause of humanity.- We should jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and work together to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity. The human race is an integral community and Earth is our common homeland. No person or country can thrive in isolation. Humanity should overcome difficulties in solidarity and pursue common development in harmony. We should keep moving toward a community with a shared future for mankind, and jointly create a better future. To build a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and levels of development coming together for shared interests, shared rights and shared responsibilities in global affairs, and creating the greatest synergy for building a better world.- We should stay committed to mutual benefit and win-win results, and work together to promote economic and social development for the greater benefit of our people. As ancient Chinese observed, "The essence of governance is livelihood, and the essence of livelihood is adequacy." Development and happy lives are the common aspirations of people in all countries. Development is meaningful only when it is for the people's interest, and can sustain only when it is motivated by the people. Countries should put their people front and center, and strive to realize development with a higher level of quality, efficiency, equity, sustainability and security. It is important to resolve the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development, and make development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive. It is also important to strengthen the people's capacity for development, foster a development environment where everyone takes part and has a share, and create a development paradigm where its outcome benefits every person in every country more directly and fairly. Not long ago, at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, I proposed a Global Development Initiative, with the hope that countries will work together to overcome impacts of COVID-19 on global development, accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build a global community of development with a shared future.- We should step up cooperation, and work together to address the various challenges and global issues facing humanity. The international community is confronted by regional disputes as well as global issues such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity. Only with more inclusive global governance, more effective multilateral mechanisms and more active regional cooperation, can these issues be addressed effectively. Climate change is Nature's alarm bell to humanity. Countries need to take concrete actions to protect Mother Nature. We need to encourage green recovery, green production and green consumption, promote a civilized and healthy way of life, foster harmony between man and Nature, and let a sound ecology and environment be the inexhaustible source of sustainable development.- We should resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the United Nations, and work together to practice true multilateralism. Building a community with a shared future for mankind requires a strong United Nations and reform and development of the global governance system. Countries should uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. International rules can only be made by the 193 UN Member States together, and not decided by individual countries or blocs of countries. International rules should be observed by the 193 UN Member States, and there is no and should be no exception. Countries should respect the United Nations, take good care of the UN family, refrain from exploiting the Organization, still less abandoning it at one's will, and make sure that the United Nations plays an even more positive role in advancing humanity's noble cause of peace and development. China will be happy to work with all countries under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to explore new ideas and new models of cooperation and keep enriching the practice of multilateralism under new circumstances.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Comrades,A review of the past can light the way forward. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and always be a builder of world peace. China will stay committed to the path of reform and opening-up and always be a contributor to global development. China will stay committed to the path of multilateralism and always be a defender of the international order.As an ancient Chinese poem reads, "Green hills immerse in the same cloud and rain. The same moon lights up towns however far away." Let us join hands, stand on the right side of history and the side of human progress, and work tirelessly for the lasting and peaceful development of the world and for building a community with a shared future for mankind!Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of The Second United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conference
14 October 2021
Your Excellency Secretary-General António Guterres,Dear Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,
It gives me great pleasure to attend the second United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conference and discuss what is important for global transport and development. Let me begin by extending, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people and also in my own name, warm congratulations on the convening of the Conference and a hearty welcome to our distinguished guests.
Transport is the artery of the economy and a bond between civilizations. A review of history shows that transport, in the forms of camel caravans and sailing boats on the ancient Silk Road, wave-breaking vessels in the Age of Exploration, and criss-cross transport networks in this modern age, has facilitated economic integration and people-to-people exchanges and turned the world into a close-knit global village.
As we speak, major changes unseen in a century, compounded by a once-in-a-century pandemic, are posing serious challenges to the global efforts of growing the economy and bettering people's lives. It is imperative that we follow the prevailing trend of world development, advance global transport cooperation, and write a new chapter featuring connectivity of infrastructure, unfettered flows of trade and investment, and interactions between civilizations.
First, we need to uphold open interplay and enhance connectivity. A big river is full when its tributaries are filled with water; and tributaries must be dry when there is no water in the big river. Only with openness, inclusiveness and connectivity can countries reinforce each other's efforts and achieve win-win results. It is important that we pursue an open world economy, reject discriminatory or exclusive rules and systems, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. We should strengthen both hard connectivity of infrastructure and soft connectivity of institutions and rules, and develop four-dimensional connectivity of land, sea, air and the Internet.
Second, we need to uphold common development and promote fairness and inclusiveness. Only when countries develop together can there be true development; only when countries prosper together can there be true prosperity. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the wealth gap and widened the North-South divide. Uneven development must be addressed before broader prospects for humanity's common development could be brought about. We should leverage the enabling role of transport and increase related input in poor regions, so that local economies and people's lives could improve as a result of better roads. We should enhance North-South and South-South cooperation and scale up support for developing transport infrastructure in the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, in an effort to achieve common prosperity.
Third, we need to uphold an innovation-driven approach and create more drivers for development. Our world is going through a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. Digital economy, artificial intelligence and other new technologies and new business forms have become strong technological underpinnings for economic and social development. More should be done to develop smart transport and smart logistics and promote deep integration of new technologies like big data, the Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain with the transport sector, to ensure easier movement of people and smoother flow of goods.
Fourth, we need to uphold ecological conservation as a priority and pursue green and low-carbon development. The only durable way to achieve sustainable development is to establish an economic system for green and low-carbon development and promote green transition in all respects of economic and social development. More efforts are needed to foster a green and low-carbon way of transport, step up green infrastructural development, promote new energy, smart, digital and light-weight transport equipment, and encourage and advocate green travel, to make transport and travel more environment-friendly and low-carbon.
Fifth, we need to uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. We live in a world where the future and destiny of countries are closely linked and their interests entwined like never before. We need to follow the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, pool the wisdom and strength of all, and mobilize resources from across the globe to meet global challenges and promote global development. We should uphold the authority and status of the United Nations and, in the context of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, advance cooperation in such areas as poverty reduction, health, transport and logistics, and infrastructural development.
Not long ago, I proposed a Global Development Initiative, which is designed to speed up the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, promote more robust, greener and more balanced global development, and build a global community of development with a shared future. I hope more will join the Initiative.
Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,
Since the founding of New China, generation after generation of the Chinese people have worked in the spirit of opening roads through mountains and putting bridges over rivers, and turned China into a country with vast transport infrastructure. Today, we are redoubling our efforts to build a country with great transport strength. Convinced that transport should come first, we have built the world's largest high-speed railway network, expressway network and world-class port clusters. We have opened air and sea routes that reach all parts of the world. We have set up an integrated transport network exceeding six million kilometers. Convinced of the need for innovation, we have achieved major breakthroughs in equipment manufacturing like high-speed trains and large aircraft. We have more than half of the world's new energy vehicles. Mega transport projects like the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Beijing Daxing International Airport have been completed and put into operation. Transport has become a frontier in China's modernization drive. Convinced of the importance of global connectivity, we have become the economy best connected to the global shipping network and with the highest volume of trade in goods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the China-Europe Railway Express and ocean-going cargo vessels have been running day and night to keep global industrial and supply chains stable, showcasing China's sense of responsibility in the global community.
Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,
China will continue to hold high the banner of true multilateralism, and stay connected with the world and abreast with the times. This way, we will contribute more to global development while pursuing our own development.
I wish to reiterate that China will not change course in its pursuit of a new system of open economy of higher standards, and China will not waver in its resolve to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. China's door of opening-up will only open wider, and will never be closed.
China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity with other countries, and develop a green Silk Road and a digital Silk Road at a faster pace. Here I announce that China will set up a Global Innovation and Knowledge Center for Sustainable Transport, as a contribution to global transport development.
Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,
Let us stick together on the promising path of connectivity and mutual benefit, jointly build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
Let me wish the Conference a full success.
                

                Remarks By Wang YiSpecial Representative of H.E. President Xi Jinping andState Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the G20 Extraordinary Leaders' Meeting on Afghanistan
12 October 2021
Your Excellency Prime Minister Mario Draghi,Distinguished Leaders,Colleagues,
Afghanistan today is at a crossroads that could lead to either order and prosperity or turbulence and downslide. The country, which has experienced many sufferings, is finally seeing the prospect of a bright path toward independence, peace and reconstruction. However, complex ethnic and religious tensions remain unresolved. Local conflicts and terrorist activities still persist. Economic and livelihood issues are particularly acute. To achieve genuine peace and stability remains a long and formidable journey. 
The experience and lessons of Afghanistan of the past two decades prove once again that the right way for countries to get along with each other is to respect independent choice of the development path by others and embrace inclusiveness and mutual learning among civilizations. Imposing one's own ideology on others, wantonly meddling in others' internal affairs, or even resorting to military intervention will only bring about incessant turbulence and poverty, and cause severe humanitarian disasters.
Leaders,Colleagues,
At a time when Afghanistan faces both challenges and opportunities, difficulties and hopes, we, as major developed countries and emerging market countries, need to leverage G20's specialties and strengths. And on the basis of respecting Afghanistan's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and supporting the basic principle of an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned process, we should move to help with the peace, stability, prosperity and development of Afghanistan and the region. To this end, China would like to make four proposals:
First, we should put people's livelihood first and help Afghanistan tackle the humanitarian crisis. Afghanistan now faces food shortage, the spread of COVID-19, and other severe difficulties. The coming winter will take an even heavier toll on people's life. We must provide urgently needed assistance as quickly as possible to help ease the plight of the Afghan people. In this connection, we should all support the role of the United Nations as the coordinator. China is accelerating the shipment of 200 million yuan worth of emergency aid to Afghanistan, including food, winter supplies, vaccines and medicine. And the first batch of aid has been delivered. Countries which caused the difficult situation in Afghanistan should draw lessons, shoulder their responsibilities in earnest, prevent humanitarian crises and refugee outflows, and avoid creating new shocks to the neighboring countries and the international community. 
Second, we should bear in mind both the near and long-term needs and help Afghanistan embark on a path of open and inclusive development. The international community should take a well-conceived and realistic approach, pursue dialogue and engagement with various parties in Afghanistan, support the Afghan people in independently choosing a development path suitable to their national conditions, and encourage and guide Afghanistan to ultimately build a broad-based and inclusive political structure and adopt moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies. The fundamental solution to the Afghanistan issue lies in helping the country continue to advance peace and reconstruction, and achieve virtuous economic and social development. The international community should take further concrete actions to this end. Countries that still have unilateral sanctions against Afghanistan should remove them as soon as possible. International financial institutions should scale up funding support for Afghanistan's poverty reduction and infrastructure programs. All parties need to work together to help Afghanistan get on to the track of sustainable development at an early date.
Third, we should be zero-tolerant for terrorism and ensure that Afghanistan is free of it. Terrorism played a part in prolonging the Afghan war and turmoil that lasted for decades. This tumor must be removed. We need to urge the relevant parties in Afghanistan to make an early decision on counterterrorism and to take credible actions; and at the same time, we should also get the international community to work together to build a united front against terrorism, abandon double standards and selective approaches, and prevent Afghanistan from slipping back into a breeding ground and sanctuary of terrorism.
Fourth, we should build broad consensus and form synergy among various Afghanistan-related mechanisms. The Afghan situation is evolving with important impact on the security and stability of the region and beyond, and various multilateral mechanisms are trying to play an active part. It is important to ensure that the United Nations remains the main channel in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan and providing humanitarian assistance, and promote complementarity and synergy among various Afghanistan-related multilateral mechanisms, so as to foster an enabling external environment for Afghanistan's peace and reconstruction and sustained development. The G20 should stick to its role as a forum for international economic cooperation, and focus on pooling wisdom and advancing cooperation from economic perspectives including humanitarian assistance and peace and reconstruction. 
Distinguished Leaders,Colleagues,
China stands ready to join hands with all parties to help Afghanistan turn a new page in its history and support the Afghan people in realizing a bright future of peace and prosperity.
Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt Leaders' Summit of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties To the Convention on Biological Diversity
12 October 2021
Dear Colleagues,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,
Good afternoon.
It gives me great pleasure to meet you virtually in Kunming and jointly attend the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. On behalf of the government and people of China as well as in my own name, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all the distinguished guests.
As a Chinese saying goes, "All beings flourish when they live in harmony and receive nourishment from Nature." Biodiversity makes Earth full of vigor and vitality, and lays the foundation for human survival and development. Protecting biodiversity helps protect Earth, our common homeland, and contributes to humanity's sustainable development. 
The Kunming conference, under the theme of "Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth", has great significance. It will work for the conclusion of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and identify targets and pathways for global biodiversity protection in the future. In this context, the international community must enhance cooperation, build consensus and pool strength to build a community of all life on Earth.
Man and Nature need to coexist in harmony. When we take care to protect Nature, Nature rewards us generously; when we exploit Nature ruthlessly, it punishes us without mercy. We need to have deep reverence for Nature, respect Nature, follow Nature's laws and protect Nature, so as to build a homeland of harmonious coexistence between man and Nature.
Green mountains are gold mountains and silver mountains. A sound ecology and environment is not just a natural asset, but also an economic asset, and it affects the potential and momentum of economic and social development. We need to speed up efforts to foster a green way of development and secure a win-win of economic growth and environmental protection, so as to build a homeland of coordinated advancement of economy and the environment.
The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow over global development and compounded challenges to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Faced with the dual tasks of economic recovery and environmental protection, developing countries need help and support all the more. We need to strengthen solidarity to overcome difficulties and let people across countries benefit more and in a fairer way from development outcomes and a sound environment, so as to build a homeland of common development of all countries.
We are living in an era both fraught with challenges and full of hopes. As long as we press ahead with perseverance, a bright future will beckon. For the sake of our common future, we need to join hands and start a new journey of high-quality development for humanity. 
First, we shall take the development of ecological civilization as our guide to coordinate the relationship between man and Nature. We need to solve the problems brought by industrial civilization, keep human activities within the limits of the ecology and environment, and carry out holistic conservation and systematic governance of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts.
Second, we shall let green transition drive our efforts to facilitate global sustainable development. We need to build a green, low-carbon and circular economic system, translate ecological strengths into development strengths, and bring out the great benefit that green mountains and clear waters can offer. We also need to step up green international cooperation and share the fruits of green development among all countries.
Third, we shall concentrate on bettering people's well-being to promote social equity and justice. We need to keep in mind the people's aspiration for a better life, pursue win-win results in environmental protection, economic development, job creation, poverty alleviation and other endeavors, and increase the sense of fulfillment, happiness and security of people in all countries.
Fourth, we shall take international law as the basis to uphold a fair and equitable international governance system. We need to practice true multilateralism, and effectively honor and implement international rules, which are not to be exploited or discarded at one's own will. The new environmental protection targets we set need to be ambitious on the one hand and pragmatic and balanced on the other, so as to make the global environmental governance system fairer and more equitable.
Colleagues,
China has made remarkable progress in building an ecological civilization. The recent story of the northward travel and return of a group of elephants in Yunnan Province in southwestern China shows the vivid results of our endeavor to protect wild animals. China will continue to advance ecological progress, stay committed to implementing the new development philosophy emphasizing innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, and build a beautiful China.
On this occasion, I wish to announce China's initiative to establish a Kunming Biodiversity Fund and take the lead by investing 1.5 billion RMB yuan to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. China also calls for and welcomes contributions from other parties to the fund.
To strengthen biodiversity protection, China is moving faster to establish a protected areas system with national parks as the mainstay. Over time, areas with the greatest importance to the natural ecosystem, and with the most unique natural landscapes, the most valuable natural heritage and the greatest biodiversity reserve will be included in the national parks system. China has officially designated its first group of national parks that includes the Three-River-Source National Park, the Giant Panda National Park, the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, the Hainan Tropical Forests National Park, and the Wuyishan National Park. The protected land area is 230,000 square kilometers and they cover nearly 30 percent of the key terrestrial wildlife species found in China. In the meantime, acting by the principle of striking a balance between on-site and translocation conservation, China has started building a system of national botanical gardens in places like Beijing and Guangzhou.
To achieve its carbon peak and neutrality targets, China will release implementation plans for peaking carbon dioxide emissions in key areas and sectors as well as a series of supporting measures, and will put in place a "1+N" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality. China will continue to readjust its industrial structure and energy mix, vigorously develop renewable energy, and make faster progress in planning and developing large wind power and photovoltaic bases in sandy areas, rocky areas and deserts. The first phase of projects with an installed capacity of approximately 100 million kilowatts have recently started construction in a smooth fashion.
Colleagues,
If we humanity do not fail Nature, Nature will not fail us. Ecological civilization represents the development trend of human civilization. Let us join hands, follow the philosophy of ecological civilization and shoulder our responsibility for future generations. Let us make joint efforts to build a community of all life on Earth, and a clean and beautiful world for us all.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister ofThe People's Republic of ChinaAt the Sixth CICA Ministerial Meeting
12 October 2021
Distinguished Colleagues,
It is a great pleasure to attend the sixth CICA Ministerial Meeting. I would like to thank President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for his attention to and support for the CICA process. My appreciation also goes to Kazakh colleagues for the thoughtful arrangements. Since assuming the chairmanship, Kazakhstan has done a great deal to advance CICA's development and promote mutual trust and cooperation in Asia. China highly commends this.
In the past 29 years since its establishment, CICA has stayed abreast with the times, expanded cooperation on confidence-building measures (CBM), and played an indispensable role in fostering an Asia featuring mutual respect and mutual trust, security and stability, progress and prosperity, openness and inclusiveness, and cooperation and innovation.
As an important member of CICA, China has always been a participant in and facilitator for CICA's development. President Xi Jinping personally attended CICA summits. He proposed a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and called for exploring a security and development path that suits Asia and serves the common interests of all, and making joint efforts to build an Asian community with a shared future. His proposals have found positive resonance from all sides.
Looking ahead, China is ready to fulfill its responsibility as the coordinator in relevant areas of CICA cooperation, and continue to hold the CICA Non-Governmental Forum, the Finance Summit, the Think Tank Forum and other events, so as to make new and greater contributions to CICA cooperation.
Colleagues, 
In the face of the pandemic and major changes unseen in a century, CICA, as the most representative cross-civilizational and cross-regional forum for multilateral security cooperation in this part of the world, should keep up with the times, harness cooperation advantages, expand cooperation practices, and contribute wisdom and strengths to the building of an Asian community with a shared future. With that in mind, China would like to make four proposals.
First, we need to continue deepening cooperation on COVID response. Given the uncertainties of the pandemic, the pressing priority at the moment is to strengthen vaccine cooperation and protect the health and security of people. With an enduring commitment to building a global community of health for all, China maintains that vaccines should be a global public good. Despite its own difficulties, China has provided altogether over 1.4 billion doses of vaccines and concentrates to the international community, making it the Number-One contributor of vaccines to the rest of the world. China has also announced that it will contribute an additional 100 million doses to developing countries on top of its US$100 million donation to COVAX.
We call on all sides to jointly carry forward the spirit of science, continue to oppose politicization, using origins-tracing as a tool, and COVID stigmatization, and take real actions to strengthen global cooperation against the pandemic.
Second, we need to join hands in maintaining security and stability. Recently, security risks in the region have become quite prominent, with new dynamics in hotspot issues and new developments of terrorism. All sides need to take robust measures to guard against all this. It is important that we act in line with the spirit of CICA cooperation, namely, equality, mutual respect, consultation for consensus, and non-interference in domestic affairs. We need to continue to settle differences through dialogue and resolve disputes through negotiations. We need to properly tackle traditional and non-traditional security threats and challenges, with a view to promoting long-term stability and security in the region. 
Although the war in Afghanistan has ended, the after effect of military intervention and "democratic transformation" by the West is far from over. Afghanistan in the future needs to move ahead toward inclusiveness and openness, toward a firm commitment against terrorism, and toward good-neighborliness. Regional countries and the international community should also work with Afghanistan in the same direction and create favorable conditions for its reconstruction and development. As Afghanistan's neighbor, China is ready to work with all sides and enable a stable transition in Afghanistan.
The trilateral security partnership, or AUKUS, put together by the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and its plan for cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines, will be harmful to the region in many ways, including creating risks of nuclear proliferation, triggering a new round of arms race, jeopardizing regional peace and stability, undermining the development of a Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, and causing a resurgence of the Cold War mentality. The international community, especially Asian countries, has been following this very closely and with vigilance. We should see clearly the nature of AUKUS and U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, and jointly oppose any attempt that goes against the common will of countries in the region and imperils regional peace and stability.
Third, we need to actively promote economic recovery. Right now, all countries face the formidable tasks of fighting COVID-19, stabilizing the economy and securing people's well-being. At the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping solemnly proposed the Global Development Initiative to implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at a faster pace, and work together for more robust, greener and more balanced global development. We look forward to active support and participation of all countries.
Asia is the world's highland of development and enjoys broad development prospects. We need to steadily advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen cooperation in such areas as connectivity, digital economy and green economy, and help achieve full economic recovery in the region. China will bring out the strengths of the massive Chinese market, and provide Asian countries with more opportunities and stronger drivers for post-COVID recovery. 
Fourth, we need to firmly practice multilateralism. In the face of the difficulties and challenges that keep emerging, the international community should stay committed to multilateralism, and uphold equity and justice now more than ever. We should reject Cold War mentality and zero-sum games, and oppose all attempts that seek to undermine the international order under the pretext of so-called "rules". We need to resolutely uphold the UN-centered international system, and vigorously advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity. We need to jointly oppose unilateralism, hegemony and power politics, uphold true multilateralism, stand on the right side of history and the side of human progress, and make even greater contributions to upholding equity, justice, peace and security in the world. 
China supports CICA's continued commitment to the principles of openness and inclusiveness. We welcome Turkmenistan as an observer. The continued expansion of the CICA partnership network represents the growth of force for progress in the international community, and will inject positive energy into the process toward greater democracy in international relations.
Colleagues,
Asia is where we survive and thrive. It is a continent full of promises. Let us put our minds together and pool our strengths with a unity of purpose, keep deepening and substantiating the CICA process in the post-COVID era, jointly promote regional development and stability, and build together an Asian community with a shared future. 
Thank you.
                

                26 September 2021
Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am very glad to attend the Sustainable Development Forum 2021 and to discuss with you grand plans for international development cooperation and to explore together ways toward sustainable development. With "people-centered sustainable development" being the theme of the Forum, our in-depth discussions will offer insights and visions for the world to achieve post-COVID recovery and advance international development cooperation.
Development is the eternal pursuit of human society. The world today is under the combined impacts of the pandemic and world-wide changes, both unseen in a century. Global economic recovery has been uneven. The pandemic has wiped off the achievements in global poverty reduction of the past ten years. And the population suffering from hunger has amounted to around 800 million. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is confronted with new challenges. As the international development cause stands at a crossroads, President Xi Jinping solemnly proposed the Global Development Initiative at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He called on the international community to accelerate implementation of the 2030 SDGs for more robust, greener and more balanced global development, and foster a global community of development with a shared future. This major Initiative has set out a blueprint for the development of countries and international development cooperation, and pointed the way forward for global development and international development cooperation. 
The Global Development Initiative embraces the people-centered core concept. It takes the betterment of people's well-being and realization of their well-rounded development as the starting point and ultimate goal, and endeavors to meet the aspirations of all nations for a better life. It focuses on development as the master key to addressing all problems, and strives to solve difficult issues of development and create more opportunities for development, leaving no countries and no individuals behind.
The Global Development Initiative follows the guidelines of practical cooperation. International development cannot be advanced with rhetoric. It needs real actions. The Initiative responds to the dynamics and urgent needs of global development, and has identified priority areas including poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 and vaccines, financing for development, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, and connectivity. To this end, it has also put forward cooperation proposals and plans to translate development consensus into pragmatic actions so as to inject new impetus to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
The Global Development Initiative advocates the spirit of open and inclusive partnership. To achieve sustainable development, we need the wisdom and strength of everyone. The Initiative is an important public good and cooperation platform that China provides to the international community. It is open to the whole world and welcomes the participation of all countries. It will form synergy with other initiatives including the Belt and Road Initiative, Agenda 2063 of the African Union, and the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It will build consensus and pool together the strengths of multilateral cooperation mechanisms such as the UN, the G20 and BRICS as well as various sub-regional and regional platforms.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,
The pandemic has brought about multiple crises and challenges in the economic, public health, food and social sectors to the international community, particularly the developing countries. Implementing the 2030 Agenda has become more important, not less. Deepening international development cooperation has become more urgent, not less. We call on all to use the implementation of the Global Development Initiative as an opportunity, make firm political commitment, and take practical actions so as to move forward the cause of international development.
We need to deepen cooperation in fighting COVID-19 to prevail together over the challenge. As the virus keeps mutating and the pandemic remains rampant, we must put in place multiple lines of defense, and do our best to stem the cross-border spread of the virus. Origins-tracing should be based on science, and we must oppose politicization and stigmatization. We need to guarantee the R&D and production of vaccines, and ensure their fair distribution. We need to ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability so as to close the "immunization gap". 
We need to strengthen macro-policy coordination to promote economic recovery. Economic growth is the important basis for promoting development. Facing the grave situation of fragile global economic recovery, all countries, major economies in particular, need to adopt responsible macro-economic policies and enhance policy communication and coordination so as to help achieve stability and growth. We need to seize the historic opportunities in the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, stay innovation-driven, and deepen cooperation on digital technologies to help developing countries realize industrialization and modernization in a better, faster way. We need to join hands to build an open world economy, and make globalization more open, more inclusive, and more balanced for the benefits of all. Any attempt to use the pandemic for the purpose of de-globalization, seclusion, de-coupling or protectionism will undermine the interests of others as well as one's own. It will lead to a dead end, and create new obstacles to the realization of the SDGs globally. 
We need to pursue green and low-carbon development to proactively tackle climate change. Green and low-carbon development is the most sustainable growth driver, and a sound eco-environment benefits everyone. We need to seize the opportunities arising from technological progress and economic transition, take the path of green development, and upgrade our economic and industrial structures as well as the energy mix at a faster pace. We need to step up systematic protection of nature, and advance global environmental governance, so as to realize harmony between man and nature and build a clean and beautiful world. We also need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, fully implement the Paris Agreement and strengthen global climate governance, with a view to promoting global ecological civilization.
We need to uphold fairness and justice and create an enabling environment for development. There is no golden rule or one-size-fits-all model for development paths of various countries. Every country should choose its own path tailored to its own realities. We should abide by international law and the basic norms governing international relations, enhance actions to silence the guns, safeguard world peace and security, and promote human rights, especially people's right to development, so as to create an enabling environment for the development of all countries. The world needs justice, not high-handedness. We should respect every country's independent choice of its path and system, treat each other as equals, readily learn from each other, and oppose bullying practices such as imposing one's will on others and interfering in others' internal affairs.
We need to safeguard true multilateralism and deepen the global development partnership. True development is sustainable, and good development is development for all. We should practice global governance guided by the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, safeguard the UN-centered international system, give full play to UN's coordinating role in promoting sustainable development, prioritize development in global macro-policy coordination, step up North-South cooperation and deepen South-South cooperation. We should provide more resources to developing countries to shore up their capacity for self-generated development, eliminate the development divide, and jointly foster a global community of development with a shared future.
Colleagues,
China always takes development as the top governance agenda, and attaches great importance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We have achieved the historic success of eliminating absolute poverty, completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and are marching toward the second centenary goal of fully building a great modern socialist country. We have put in place the world's largest social security network and compulsory education system, and expanded China's middle-income population by hundreds of millions, resulting in a notably greater sense of happiness, satisfaction and fulfillment among the Chinese people. Firmly committed to the vision of a community of life for man and nature, China has been coordinating its management of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands, deserts and glaciers, robustly implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, and adhering to the path of green, low-carbon and circular development by constantly upgrading its industrial structure and energy mix. We have partnered with 141 countries in Belt and Road cooperation to promote common development through greater connectivity. Despite COVID-19, the China-Europe Railway Express remains in active service, and the development of the green Silk Road, the digital Silk Road and the health Silk Road is gaining momentum, delivering solid progress according to the vision of open, green and clean cooperation for high-standard, people-centered and sustainable development based on extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. In his statement a few days ago at the General Debate of the UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping announced that China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. This is one of the many important decisions China voluntarily made to help tackle global climate change. We will strive to make new contributions to green development of the world through our actions.
As the largest developing country, China always stands in solidarity with other developing countries. We have been actively promoting South-South cooperation, and have provided development aid to more than 160 developing countries. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have carried out the largest global humanitarian operation since the founding of the People's Republic. We are honoring our solemn pledge to make Chinese vaccines a global public good, and have provided more than 1.25 billion doses of vaccines for the world. President Xi Jinping announced recently that China will provide a total of two billion doses of vaccines for the rest of the world by the end of this year, and that on top of the US$100 million donation to COVAX, China will donate an additional 100 million doses to fellow developing countries within this year. This is China's important contribution to global vaccination. China will release its Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021) and Big Earth Data in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals (2021), which we believe will provide useful experience for the international implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
An ancient Chinese philosopher once observed, "Devote your attention to the basics, and when you master them, you will find the way." China stands ready to work with all parties to advance the Global Development Initiative, and contribute our strength to quickening the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to delivering more benefits to the people of all countries. Let us work together to open a bright future for international development cooperation and build a community with a shared future for mankind.
Thank you.

22 September 2021
Mr. Chair,
Eliminating racism in all its forms and ensuring that everyone is equal in dignity and rights is the spirit of the UN Charter and a manifestation of international fairness and justice.
The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is a banner for the global movement against racism and a shared commitment of all countries. It is most timely and crucial for the General Assembly to hold this commemorative meeting on the 20th anniversary of this guiding document. China warmly welcomes and firmly supports this initiative.
Slave trade and colonialism are the primary root causes of racism. People of African and Asian descent and indigenous peoples were victims of such practices in the past, and continue to bear their consequences even today. The relevant countries should at least have the courage to face up to this disgraceful past, and take measures to end the sufferings caused by their practices. More important, they are duty-bound to take the lead in rejecting racism in all its forms.
China urges all countries to adopt a zero-tolerance attitude, build and improve their legal frameworks against racism, and fully and earnestly implement the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. In particular, countries should truly resolve systemic racism and law enforcement violence, prohibit the incitement of racial hostility, and end impunity.
China advocates more dialogue and exchanges between races and between cultures, and rejects arrogance and prejudice based on race, color or language. China believes in a culture of respect, tolerance and equality, and a social environment free from discrimination. In this respect, political leaders and the media should take up their special responsibilities.
China calls for the ensurance of the right to development for all, so as to eradicate the breeding ground for racism, including poverty, marginalization, social exclusion and economic gap, and break the vicious cycle between social inequality and racism. To this end, it is imperative to accelerate the implementation of UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and leave no individual and no country behind.
China supports the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and will continue its implementation. We will work with all countries in unrelenting efforts to eliminate racism and build a world of equality for all.
Thank you.
                

                
Statement by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the General Debate of the 76th Session of The United Nations General Assembly
21 September 2021
Mr. President,
The year 2021 is a truly remarkable one for the Chinese people. This year marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China. It is also the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, a historic event which will be solemnly commemorated by China. We will continue our active efforts to take China's cooperation with the United Nations to a new level and make new and greater contributions to advancing the noble cause of the UN.
Mr. President,
A year ago, global leaders attended the high-level meetings marking the 75th anniversary of the UN and issued a declaration pledging to fight COVID-19 in solidarity, tackle challenges together, uphold multilateralism, strengthen the role of the UN, and work for the common future of present and coming generations.
One year on, our world is facing the combined impacts of changes unseen in a century and the COVID-19 pandemic. In all countries, people long for peace and development more than ever before, their call for equity and justice is growing stronger, and they are more determined in pursuing win-win cooperation.
Right now, COVID-19 is still raging in the world, and profound changes are taking place in human society. The world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation. It falls on each and every responsible statesman to answer the questions of our times and make a historical choice with confidence, courage and a sense of mission.
First, we must beat COVID-19 and win this decisive fight crucial to the future of humanity. The history of world civilization is also one of fighting pandemics. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement. The current pandemic may appear overwhelming, but we humanity will surely overcome it and prevail.
We should always put people and their lives first, and care about the life, value and dignity of every individual. We need to respect science, take a science-based approach, and follow the laws of science. We need to both follow routine, targeted COVID-19 protocols and take emergency response measures, and both carry out epidemic control and promote economic and social development. We need to enhance coordinated global COVID-19 response and minimize the risk of cross-border virus transmission.
Vaccination is our powerful weapon against COVID-19. I have stressed on many occasions the need to make vaccines a global public good and ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries. Of pressing priority is to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines globally. China will strive to provide a total of two billion doses of vaccines to the world by the end of this year. In addition to donating 100 million US dollars to COVAX, China will donate 100 million doses of vaccines to other developing countries in the course of this year. China will continue to support and engage in global science-based origins tracing, and stands firmly opposed to political maneuvering in whatever form.
Second, we must revitalize the economy and pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Development holds the key to people's well-being. Facing the severe shocks of COVID-19, we need to work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth. To this end, I would like to propose a Global Development Initiative.
- Staying committed to development as a priority. We need to put development high on the global macro policy agenda, strengthen policy coordination among major economies, and ensure policy continuity, consistency and sustainability. We need to foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, forge greater synergy among multilateral development cooperation processes, and speed up the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
- Staying committed to a people-centered approach. We should safeguard and improve people's livelihoods and protect and promote human rights through development, and make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. We should continue our work so that the people will have a greater sense of happiness, benefit and security, and achieve well-rounded development.
- Staying committed to benefits for all. We should care about the special needs of developing countries. We may employ such means as debt suspension and development aid to help developing countries, particularly vulnerable ones facing exceptional difficulties, with emphasis on addressing unbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries. 
- Staying committed to innovation-driven development. We need to seize the historic opportunities created by the latest round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, redouble efforts to harness technological achievements to boost productivity, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology. We should foster new growth drivers in the post-COVID era and jointly achieve leapfrog development. 
- Staying committed to harmony between man and nature. We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve green recovery and development. China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals. China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.
-Staying committed to results-oriented actions. We need to increase input in development, advance on a priority basis cooperation on poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas, and accelerate implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to build a global community of development with a shared future. China has pledged an additional three billion US dollars of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic and social recovery. 
Third, we must strengthen solidarity and promote mutual respect and win-win cooperation in conducting international relations. A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy. Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm. We need to advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games. 
Differences and problems among countries, hardly avoidable, need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect. One country's success does not have to mean another country's failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. We need to pursue dialogue and inclusiveness over confrontation and exclusion. We need to build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, and do the best we can to expand the convergence of our interests and achieve the biggest synergy possible.
The Chinese people have always celebrated and striven to pursue the vision of peace, amity and harmony. China has never and will never invade or bully others, or seek hegemony. China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development. 
Fourth, we must improve global governance and practice true multilateralism. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the United Nations at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. 
The UN should hold high the banner of true multilateralism and serve as the central platform for countries to jointly safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart the course for the future of the world. The UN should stay committed to ensuring a stable international order, increasing the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs, and taking the lead in advancing democracy and rule of law in international relations. The UN should advance, in a balanced manner, work in all the three areas of security, development and human rights. It should set common agenda, highlight pressing issues and focus on real actions, and see to it that commitments made by all parties to multilateralism are truly delivered. 
Mr. President, 
The world is once again at a historical crossroads. I am convinced that the trend of peace, development and advancement for humanity is irresistible. Let us bolster confidence and jointly address global threats and challenges, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind and a better world for all.
                

                Address by H.E. Wang YiMember of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central CommitteeState Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Symposium on the International Situation andChina’s Foreign RelationsBeijing, 25 December 2022Dear Experts and Friends,It’s a pleasure to meet you all again and join you in review and preview of the international situation and China’s foreign relations. As the world is undergoing historic changes of profound and far-reaching impact, we need more than ever a vision to guide our way forward, a viable way to address our challenges, and greater strength to build consensus. I am more than pleased to have this opportunity to share with you my perspective on these issues and I look forward to benefiting from your insights.For both the world and China, the outgoing 2022 is critical in bridging the past and the future.Around the world, the trends of transformation and turbulence are both evolving continuously and the tendencies toward unity and division are both surging and contending with each other.Like a giant ship, human society sailed through the raging waves of the once-in-a-century pandemic. It also had to brave for the hurricanes of geopolitical conflicts, whirlpools of bloc confrontation, undercurrents of surging inflation, and cold waves of energy crunch. The journey has been choppy and tumultuous.That said, crisis begets change, giving birth to hopes. Most of the developing countries have acted with greater purpose in standing together in solidarity and strengthening mutual cooperation, and they have responded to the many unprecedented changes with greater confidence.In the new global context, any attempt of conflict, confrontation, containment and decoupling runs against the prevailing trend of our times and is doomed to fail; peace, development, cooperation and win-win represent the popular will of the people and are an international trend.In China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united the whole Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and led us in rising to challenges of high winds and choppy waters in the global environment and pressing ahead with formidable tasks in advancing reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability at home. It has led us in overcoming all difficulties, addressing both domestic and international imperatives, making coordinated progress in COVID-19 response and in economic and social development, and scoring new, great successes in the cause of the Party and the country.The most important event of the year is the 20th CPC National Congress held in October, which maps out a grand blueprint for building a modern socialist country in all respects and for advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts. The Congress also offers China’s solutions to the problems facing all humanity, providing much-needed certainty and stability to a world rocked by changes and turmoil.Dear Friends,Over the year, China has met challenges head-on and advanced its diplomatic agenda with greater resolve. Under the personal guidance of President Xi Jinping and the effective planning of the CPC Central Committee, China’s head-of-state diplomacy has played a guiding role. Our diplomatic work has focused on ensuring the success of the 20th CPC National Congress as our top priority and on building a community with a shared future for mankind as our vision. We have adapted to changes, addressed adversities and broken new ground. We have conducted major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in an all-round way, making new contribution to upholding world peace and promoting common development.First, our head-of-state diplomacy has been immensely successful with one significant event after another and has set the pace for China’s overall diplomatic work. This can be highlighted as one home-ground event, two major initiatives, and three important visits.The home-ground event is the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. With the concerted efforts of China and the international community, the Games were a resounding success. The opening ceremony brought together 31 heads of state, government, and international organizations from five continents who joined us in the celebration of the Games. The international community has experienced a China that is more confident, striving, open and inclusive. The Beijing rendezvous on ice and snow marked a new milestone in the endeavor of the peoples across the world to embrace new hopes and pursue a shared future together.The two major initiatives are the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). In April this year, President Xi Jinping unveiled the GSI at the Boao Forum for Asia, offering a Chinese proposal for addressing global security challenges and achieving durable peace and security in the world. The international community responded to the GSI favorably. In a matter of six months, over 70 countries have expressed endorsement and support of the initiative.As the chair of the first High-level Dialogue on Global Development held in June on the margins of a BRICS Summit, President Xi Jinping announced 32 major measures China would take to implement the GDI; an open-ended pool of GDI projects and the Global Development Promotion Center were created. To date, more than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, have committed support to the GDI; close to 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI.The three major visits refer to those made by President Xi Jinping from September to December, the first of its kind since the COVID-19 outbreak. They include the Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Samarkand, the G20 Summit in Bali and the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Bangkok, and the first China-Arab States Summit and the China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit in Riyadh.In the period before and after the 20th CPC National Congress, President Xi Jinping attended five multilateral summits and held bilateral meetings with leaders of more than 40 countries, creating three peaks for head-of-state diplomacy this year and making a good start to the work of the CPC’s new collective central leadership in China’s foreign affairs.Second, we have continued to reject bloc confrontation and zero-sum competition, and maintained strategic stability in relations with other major countries. Major countries need to lead by example in making the world a better place. How they engage one another bears on the future of humanity. Taking on its responsibilities for the world and for history, China has worked relentlessly for a major-country relationship that features peaceful coexistence, overall stability and balanced development.We have firmly rejected the United States’ erroneous China policy and have been exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other. As the United States has stubbornly continued to see China as its primary competitor and engage in blatant blockade, suppression and provocation against China, China-US relations were plunged into serious difficulties. In response, China has taken resolute actions to counter such power politics and bullying while pointing the right way forward through open and candid communication.President Xi Jinping has had two phone calls with President Joe Biden at the request of the latter. The two presidents also had a face-to-face meeting in Bali, the first of its kind in three years. President Xi Jinping analyzed the essence of China-US relations and drew China’s bottom line and red line. He also stressed the need to abandon the zero-sum mentality where one’s gain and rise mean the other’s loss and decline, to define China-US interactions by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition, and to bring China-US relations back on the right track of healthy and stable development under the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.The candid and in-depth communication between the two presidents was constructive and strategic. It is clear from these talks that the two leaders both attach importance to the global significance of China-US relations, and emphasize the importance of exploring and establishing the guiding principles of China-US relations. They both hope the bilateral ties will stop sliding and return to stability as quickly as possible, and both agree to effectively manage differences and advance practical cooperation.President Biden reaffirmed his “five-noes” statement, and further indicated that the US does not support “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China, and has no intention to seek “decoupling” from China, to halt China’s economic development or to contain China.  What has happened proves time and again that China and the United States cannot decouple or sever supply chains. Under new circumstances, the common interests between China and the United States have increased, not decreased. No conflict, no confrontation and peaceful coexistence are in the common interests of both countries; deepening economic integration and benefiting more from each other’s development are also in the common interests of both; and boosting the global economy, tackling climate change, and resolving regional hot-spot issues remain the common interests.Playing up competition does all harm and no good, and seeking cooperation is a necessity not a choice. China urges the US side to honor its commitments, turn President Biden’s positive statements into action, stop containing and suppressing China, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs, stop undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and cultivate a favorable atmosphere for communication and cooperation between the two sides. We call on the US side to change its course, establish an objective and sensible perception of China, follow a positive and pragmatic China policy, and work with us to put in place the pillars and a solid foundation for the healthy and stable growth of China-US relations.We have deepened good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation with Russia, and made China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination more mature and resilient. President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin met in Beijing for a “rendezvous with Winter Olympics”, and held an important meeting in Samarkand, providing strategic guidance for China-Russia relations to move ahead under new circumstances.Over the past year, China and Russia have firmly supported each other in upholding respective core interests, and our political and strategic mutual trust has been further consolidated. Our bilateral trade is approaching the US$200 billion target at a faster pace. Major investment projects are well underway. The scale of local currency settlement further expands. The Heihe highway bridge and Tongjiang railway bridge are open to traffic. Landmark progress has been secured in cross-border connectivity, and both countries have a stronger drive to develop mutually beneficial cooperation.As some country is seeking to revive the Cold War mentality and fabricating the false narrative of democracy versus authoritarianism, China and Russia have stood in solidarity with other countries to steadfastly push for multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations, and steadfastly oppose hegemony and reject a new Cold War.The China-Russia relationship, which is based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party, remains rock-solid. Such relationship is free from interference or any attempt to sow discord between the two countries, and is immune from changes in the international environment.We have continued to pursue friendship and cooperation with Europe, and stay committed to the healthy development of China-Europe relations. China-Europe cooperation bears on the stability of the global landscape and the prosperity of the Eurasian continent. Friendship is the keynote of China’s Europe policy, and cooperation its overarching goal. We are happy to see stronger European strategic autonomy. We support European integration. And we expect the EU to play a greater role in international affairs.Over the past year, President Xi Jinping had over 20 phone calls and meetings with European leaders, and received German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President of the European Council Charles Michel in China. Two-way trade and investment between China and Europe has bucked the trend and continued to grow. A host of major projects have been completed successively. These are full evidence that China and Europe are each other’s partners, not rivals, and we are each other’s opportunities, not threats.China and Europe are working together on the global stage to practice true multilateralism, and meet global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity. Such cooperation is of important significance to the world, and offers a source of inspiration to humanity.On the basis of mutual respect and equality, we will work continuously with the European side to properly handle differences and disagreements, strengthen strategic communication and results-oriented cooperation, and jointly act as an anchor of stability for the Eurasian continent and serve as a new powerhouse of development and prosperity.Third, we have followed an open regionalism to build a stable and prosperous Asian home together. Facing attempts by some country to bring bloc confrontation to Asia and disrupt peace and stability in the region, we have stayed committed to the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness and the policy of good-neighborliness and friendship. China supports countries in the region in distancing from the geopolitical trap. Together we have made solidarity and cooperation a salient feature of the Asian region. Solid strides have been made in building a community with a shared future in the neighborhood.The China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership, launched with a strong start, is gaining a robust momentum. The two sides have agreed on a plan of action to advance the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. Historic progress has been made in building a China-Indonesia and China-Thailand community with a shared future. Lancang-Mekong countries are committed to setting a “golden example” for regional cooperation. APEC has resumed dialogue on the FTAAP agenda. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is implemented with high quality. The China-Laos-Thailand Connectivity Development Corridor Outlook will soon be turned into reality. The dividends of regional integration are being unleashed at a faster pace. China-ASEAN cooperation stays at the forefront of the times. The two sides are working together to foster a secure environment and create impetus for growth, and are taking solid steps to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together.China and Central Asian countries have celebrated the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations, and agreed to set up a meeting mechanism at the head-of-state level and build an even closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future. We have reached important consensus with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on building a community with a shared future on the bilateral level. New progress has been made in the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, and new impetus injected to the development of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor. Countries in the region have jointly fought external attempts to instigate color revolution, and combating the forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, effectively maintaining peace and stability in the region. The SCO has completed a new round of its membership expansion, the largest of its kind since its inception. This provides a stronger safeguard for peace and development of the Eurasian continent.China and Japan have had a joint commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral relations. Leaders of the two countries held their first face-to-face meeting in three years, and reached important consensus on promoting the stability and growth of the bilateral ties. The two countries need to take history as a mirror, treat each other with sincerity, and engage each other with trust. It is important to avoid backpedaling and flip-flopping, be far-sighted and forward-looking, and steer the course of the bilateral relations from a strategic perspective.China and India have maintained communication through the diplomatic and military-to-military channels, and both countries are committed to upholding stability in the border areas. We stand ready to work with India in the direction toward steady and sound growth of China-India relations.China and Pakistan have continued to firmly support each other, uphold the invaluable all-weather strategic partnership, and consolidate the iron-clad friendship.China-ROK relations have gone through a smooth transition and moved forward on the basis of the 30 years of diplomatic relations.China and Mongolia have strengthened the synergy between their development strategies, and stayed committed to jointly advancing modernization as well as common development and prosperity.China has continued to actively seek solutions with Chinese characteristics to hot-spot issues. We have hosted a successful Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan and the first “Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan Plus Afghanistan” Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue. The Tunxi Initiative issued highlights the participants’ commitment to inclusiveness and reconstruction in Afghanistan.We have firmly safeguarded peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, and called on the main parties involved to take and address reasonable concerns seriously.We have supported ASEAN mediation over the issue of Myanmar in the ASEAN Way and its implementation of the five-point consensus.We have leveraged the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) to call on the relevant parties to steer clear of obstacles, speed up consultations, and reach agreement on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) at an earlier date, which hopefully will provide strong underpinning for long-term stability and security in the South China Sea.Fourth, we have promoted solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries based on sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pooled synergy in seeking strength through unity. China has stood in solidarity with other developing countries amid an evolving international environment, global volatility, and multiple crises, and worked together to uphold international justice and promote common interests.We have written a new chapter in BRICS cooperation. As BRICS chair, China hosted the 14th BRICS Summit and a High-level Dialogue on Global Development. Both events were a great success. The China Year of BRICS achieved remarkable results. Some 160 high-level events in various areas were held throughout the year. The BRICS countries have projected a resounding voice for global equity and justice, and injected strong BRICS impetus into global economic recovery and development.BRICS has steadily expanded its membership and held its first BRICS Plus foreign ministers’ meeting. Over 70 countries and international organizations were invited to attend BRICS Plus events of various kinds. A dozen of countries have expressly indicated their willingness to join the BRICS family. BRICS cooperation has become a most influential platform for South-South cooperation. A host of emerging markets are taking great strides to catch up in terms of global governance, turning from followers to forerunners.We forged a new paradigm of equality, sincerity and mutual assistance among developing countries. China-Africa cooperation has been elevated across the board. We have acted on the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests to accelerate the implementation of the nine programs of China-Africa cooperation, and supported Africa’s self-sustained development. We have donated vaccines and provided food assistance to Africa to meet its pressing needs. We have come up with an Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa to find ways to address their deep-seated challenges. We have taken the lead in publicly supporting the inclusion of the African Union in G20 and have continued to encourage Africa to play a bigger global role. China-Arab relations have taken historic strides forward. President Xi Jinping attended the first China-Arab States Summit and the China-GCC Summit, and conducted China’s highest-level diplomatic engagement with the Arab world on the largest-scale since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949. China and Arab states have reached consensus on building a closer China-Arab community with a shared future. President Xi Jinping announced eight initiatives for cooperation between the Chinese and Arab sides. China and the GCC have established a strategic partnership, which is growing closer. As two significant forces and major civilizations, China and the Arab world have joined hands and supported each other in advancing our respective national rejuvenation endeavors and promoting regional peace and development. China and Latin America and the Caribbean have deepened strategic consensus. China and Argentina celebrated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. China and Cuba have launched a joint endeavor to build a community with a shared future. China has also worked with other countries in the region to increase experience sharing on state governance, strengthen synergy between development strategies, and expand results-oriented cooperation.China’s relations with Pacific Island countries have made ground-breaking progress. My latest visit to the region covered each and every Pacific Island country that has diplomatic ties with China. It was the first time of its kind in our diplomatic history. China has built six cooperation platforms tailored to their development needs and people’s expectations and designed to support their climate action, poverty reduction, agriculture, disaster prevention, application of Juncao technology, and emergency supplies.Fifth, we have played a constructive role in addressing global challenges and exhibited a strong sense of responsibility and mission as a major country. With regard to the Ukraine crisis, we have consistently upheld the fundamental principles of objectivity and impartiality, without favoring one side or the other, or adding fuel to the fire, still less seeking selfish gains from the situation. We have kept to the right direction of promoting peace talks, searched for a solution that addresses both symptoms and root causes of the issue, and stood firm as an anchor of peace instead of fanning the flame of the conflict.Following the outbreak of the crisis, President Xi Jinping put forward four points about what must be done and four things the international community must do together. He emphasized that conflicts and wars produce no winner, there is no simple solution to a complex issue, and confrontation between major countries must be avoided. China has been playing a constructive role in its own way to promote peace talks and help ease the humanitarian crises.Whenever a developing country encountered difficulties, China has reached out to them with a helping hand and shown empathy. China has implemented the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in all respects and contributed the largest deferral amount under the G20 Common Framework. We have proposed a G20 Action Plan on Digital Innovation and Cooperation, which is designed to narrow the North-South digital divide and improve the capability of sustainable development of developing countries.In the face of common challenges for humanity, we have never failed to take on our responsibility and have always come up with our own proposals.In response to the rising challenges to global security, China has worked actively for a joint statement of leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states on preventing nuclear wars, which was issued as a result.In response to the raging global food and energy crises, China has called for building a global partnership for economic recovery and put forward the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security.In response to climate change, China has steadfastly pursued green, low-carbon and sustainable development, and actively fostered a fair and equitable system of global climate governance for win-win cooperation. This is a clear demonstration of China’s readiness to shoulder its responsibility as a major country and play an exemplary role.Sixth, we have not been intimidated by any hegemonic power or its bullying, and have acted resolutely to safeguard China’s core interests and national dignity. The Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests. It is the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and a red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.In response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s provocative visit to the Taiwan region of China in disregard of China’s stern warnings, we have taken firm and resolute measures, which have strongly deterred anti-China elements in the United States and the “Taiwan independence” forces, and fully demonstrated our iron will in safeguarding national sovereignty and security.Over 170 countries and international organizations have expressed support and recognition of the one-China principle. Governments, political parties and parliaments of more than 100 countries and multiple international organizations have made public statements to demonstrate their understanding and support of China’s measures to uphold national sovereignty. As countries that stand in solidarity with China on the Taiwan question represent over 80 percent of the global population, it is a strong indication of unequivocal commitment of the international community to the one-China principle.In response to the attempts of a few countries to smear China by means of concocted stories about Xinjiang and human rights issues, we have debunked lies and false narratives by presenting the facts. We have invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and many international representatives to Xinjiang. We have foiled the repeated anti-China attempts of the United States and its Western allies at the United Nations. The support for China’s justified position from over 100 countries has been overwhelming. A lot of developing countries highlight it as not only China’s victory, but also the victory of all developing countries, and the victory of international fairness and justice.We have also exposed the false narrative of “democracy versus authoritarianism”, making clear their real intention is to stoke confrontation between countries, divide the international community, and interfere in other countries’ internal affairs in the name of so-called “democracy”. We have explained to the world how and why our whole-process people’s democracy works in China, upheld the true democratic spirit, promoted a right perception of democracy in a bid to distinguish right from wrong and truth from falsehood. The world does not accept any monopoly on the definition of democracy, and the calls against drawing ideological faultlines are getting stronger.Seventh, we have created new momentum in opening-up and external cooperation, which affords great opportunities for world economic recovery. Despite growing risks in the world economy and surging undercurrents of protectionism, China has opened its door even wider to the world and never stopped deepening its external cooperation.Over the year, we have opened our arms wider to embrace the world. From the World Economic Forum to the China International Import Expo (CIIE), President Xi Jinping has sent a strong message of promoting economic globalization and announced new steps to expand higher-standard opening-up.The fifth CIIE has attracted enthusiastic participation, and new achievements were made in the China International Fair for Trade in Services, the China Import and Export Fair and the China International Consumer Products Expo. To invest in China is to invest in the future — this has become a view widely shared by people around the world.With the negative list for foreign investment further shortened, the Hainan Free Trade Port setting sail, and the development of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor moving forward at a faster pace, a new structure of all-round opening-up that coordinates the coastal and inland areas and connects the eastern and western regions is taking shape.Over the year, we have achieved swift and steady progress in advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and delivered successful outcomes. In the first 11 months of this year, China’s trade with Belt and Road partners grew by 20.4 percent despite the downward trends elsewhere. The China-Europe Railway Express completed a record number of services, showing strong resilience.A large number of signature projects made important advances: the first high-speed railway in ASEAN made its trial run; the first expressway in Cambodia is now up and running; the China-Laos railway, which had already been put into operation, has delivered remarkable performance; and the Budapest-Belgrade railway and the Pelješac Bridge in Croatia have effectively improved local transportation.China signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with another five countries this year, making the Belt and Road family a big gathering of 150 countries and 32 international organizations. This marks a new height in international economic cooperation, and serves as a new engine driving the development of all countries.Eighth, we have acted on the commitment of serving the people through diplomacy, and worked with all our hearts, minds and strength to protect the interests of Chinese nationals abroad. We in the diplomatic service have always put the people front and center and put actions behind the purpose of whole-heartedly serving the people.Ever since the turn of events in Ukraine, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have been highly concerned about the safety and security of Chinese nationals in Ukraine. President Xi Jinping has taken up the matter personally on a number of occasions and demanded an all-out effort to ensure the safety and security of Chinese nationals. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has activated its consular emergency response mechanism at the first instance and carried out emergency evacuation, ensuring the safe transfer of over 5,200 Chinese nationals amid the on-going warfare.We have promptly responded to a series of emergencies around the world, issued timely safety alerts, evacuated Chinese from high-risk areas, and spared no effort in rescuing Chinese hostages.With concrete actions on the ground, we have shown every one of our compatriots overseas that however far you are away from home, the motherland will always come to take you home in times of need.We have rolled out an upgraded Spring Sprout program around the world to vaccinate over 4.6 million Chinese nationals living and working in 180 countries. We have continued to deliver Spring Festival kits and health kits, and arranged to bring home Chinese citizens who were stranded abroad and in dire need of help.We have continued to improve consular services, and launched the building of a consular information system to make services at our diplomatic and consular missions readily accessible at fingertips. Our consular protection hotline 12308 has operated 24/7, and handled nearly 500,000 calls throughout the year. No matter where our overseas compatriots are, consular protection will always be there for them. We will never stop serving the people through diplomatic work. The care and love of the motherland will always be around.Dear Friends,Breaking waves in the changing landscape and forging ahead in a volatile world, China’s diplomacy has scored historic achievements. In retrospect, the most fundamental political underpinning is the stewardship of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and his sensible, strategic judgement, decisions and directions at every critical moment; the most important theoretical achievement is the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, which provides the guideline for China’s work of foreign affairs to break new ground in the new era; and the most valuable practical experience is the blazing of a new path of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, which demonstrates China’s strong sense of mission and responsibility as a major-country.As we look to the future, the report to the 20th CPC National Congress has pointed the direction, provided the basic policy and made strategic plans for major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. On the new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects:We will stay committed to our original aspiration and founding mission, and dedicate ourselves to pursuing human progress and world harmony. We will have a deep reflection on the future of humanity, devote ourselves to achieving rejuvenation and lasting greatness for the Chinese nation, commit ourselves to the noble cause of peace and development for humanity, and contribute to the grand cause of the continuation and transformation of the international system.We will stay committed to a Chinese path to modernization, not only creating a new form of human advancement, but also providing new choices for developing countries. We will firmly support developing countries in exploring development paths suited to their national conditions and embarking on a fast track toward modernization at an early date.We will stay committed to peaceful development, never seek hegemony or expansion, oppose hegemonism and power politics of all forms and manifestations, defend the legitimate rights of our people and people of all countries to pursue peace and development, and make China’s contribution to addressing deficits in development and security.We will stay committed to a global vision and to the noble cause of common good. We will follow the right approach in advancing the cause, promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and work for building an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.We will stay committed to high-standard opening-up, pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening-up, adhere to the right course of economic globalization, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation and the building of an open world economy, and create new opportunities for the world with China’s own development.We will stay committed to independence, seek partnership and dialogue instead of alliance and confrontation, decide our position on issues based on their own merits, pursue mutual respect, trust and benefit with all countries, and deepen and expand global partnerships featuring equality, openness and cooperation.We will stay committed to dialogue between civilizations, respect the diversity and equality of civilizations, and advocate exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations. We will promote the common values of humanity, and turn democracy and freedom from the political tools manipulated by a few people into the values shared by all mankind.We will stay committed to our fighting spirit, which is for the purpose of upholding principles and promoting justice. China’s core interests must not be undermined, its sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon, and the cause of national reunification and rejuvenation must not be disrupted — this is a matter of pride and confidence for us as Chinese and is also a great sense of integrity of the Chinese nation.Dear Friends,The year 2023 marks the beginning of full implementation of the guiding principles laid down at the 20th CPC National Congress and a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects. The new journey is one of glory and dream, but there are also major tests along the way.We will rally even more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and acquire a deep understanding of the decisive significance of establishing Comrade Xi Jinping’s core position in both the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole and establishing the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We will strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. We will enhance confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position in both the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole as well as the authority of the Party Central Committee and its centralized, unified leadership. We will fully implement the policies set by the 20th CPC National Congress, and break new ground in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. To this end:First, we will better serve head-of-state diplomacy and central tasks. Next year, head-of-state diplomacy will reach a new climax, and many highlights are expected in home-ground diplomacy. We will seize the momentum following the 20th CPC National Congress, spare no effort in strengthening overall planning and providing good services, and create new prospects for the cause of the Party and the country on the new journey in the new era. We will bear in mind the country’s most fundamental interests, and make sure our work conforms with the central tasks of the Party and the country. We will accurately understand and wisely respond to changes, and take action to make changes. We will do our best to prevent and defuse major external risks and challenges.Second, we will expand all-round diplomacy in a coordinated manner. We will deepen strategic mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Russia, and cement China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination.We will follow through on the common understandings reached between the Chinese and US Presidents, strive to recalibrate China-US relationship, and bring it back on the right course. We will engage in closer high-level exchanges and strategic communication with Europe and promote the sound and steady growth of China-Europe relations.We will stay committed to the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendship and partnership in our neighborhood, and deepen friendship, mutual trust and convergence of interests with our neighbors.We will uphold the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests, strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries, and safeguard and expand the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.Third, we will continue to look for the widest possible convergence of interests in global governance. We will hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and vigorously advocate the common values of humanity. Through building a new type of international relations and based on the implementation of the GDI and the GSI, we will firmly uphold the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law, and build more consensus, pool greater strength and take more actions for the cause of global development and security.Fourth, we will actively serve high-quality development and opening-up. Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of President Xi Jinping’s proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative. All parties are looking forward to the convening of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation where we can jointly take stock of the achievements and draw up a blueprint to make this “belt of development” that benefits the world more prosperous and broaden this “road to happiness” that benefits humanity.The significant achievements and latest developments in COVID control have ushered in a new stage in the pandemic response. Given the situation, we consider it necessary to further facilitate the flow of personnel between China and other countries, ensure stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, and foster new drivers for global development.Fifth, we will build a stronger line of defense to protect our national interests. We will unequivocally oppose all acts of hegemony, bullying and highhandedness, reject all unilateral protectionist moves, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, resolutely fight all forces that attempt to hold back and even halt the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and hold the strategic initiative of national development and security firmly in our own hands.Sixth, we will focus on strengthening our international communication capacity and make our voice heard loud and clear. We will communicate the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress to the world, and tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, so as to steadily increase the world’s understanding and recognition of the Chinese path, visions and system. We will adapt to the new developments in digitalization and omnimedia, to spread truth to more places and leave no room for lies.Dear Friends,The best way to celebrate our history is to write a new page for the future. The best way to embrace the future is to create an even brighter future.On the new journey ahead, we in the diplomatic service will follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, and stand firmly on the right side of history and on the side of progress of human civilizations. We will maintain a global vision, forge ahead with greater resolve, and write a new chapter and secure new successes in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics from a broader perspective and through stronger actions.Thank you.
                

                On the evening of 15 December, President Xi Jinping delivered a video message to the opening of the High-Level Segment of the second part of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity held in Montreal, Canada.President Xi pointed out that humanity lives in a community with a shared future, and that solidarity and cooperation is the only effective way to address global challenges. A sound ecosystem is essential for the prosperity of civilization. It is important to work together to promote harmonious co-existence between man and Nature, build a community of all life on the Earth, and create a clean and beautiful world for us all.To that end, President Xi proposed the following:— To build global consensus on biodiversity protection, jointly work for the conclusion of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and identify targets and pathways for global biodiversity protection.— To push forward the global process of biodiversity protection, turn ambitions into action, support developing countries in capacity-building, and coordinate efforts to address climate change, biodiversity loss and other global challenges.— To promote green development through biodiversity protection, speed up the green transition of development modes and lifestyle, and leverage the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to deliver greater benefits to people of all countries.— To uphold a fair and equitable global order on biodiversity protection, firmly defend true multilateralism, firmly support the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law, and form strong synergy for protecting the Earth, our common homeland.President Xi stressed that China has made active efforts to promote ecological progress and biodiversity protection, and the diversity, stability and sustainability of its ecosystem have kept improving. China has found a path of biodiversity protection with Chinese characteristics. Going forward, China will continue to advance ecological progress, and plan its development in the context of promoting harmonious co-existence between man and Nature. China will respond to the Action Plan for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and launch a large number of key projects on biodiversity protection and restoration. China will deepen international exchanges and cooperation, and do its best to provide support and assistance to fellow developing countries through the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC) and the Kunming Biodiversity Fund, so as to elevate global biodiversity governance to a new height.
                

                Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Good morning.On behalf of the Chinese government and people, and also in my own name, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the convening of today’s meeting.Humanity lives in a community with a shared future. Be it in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, or in enhancing biodiversity protection and achieving sustainable development globally, solidarity and cooperation is the only effective way to address global challenges. A sound ecosystem is essential for the prosperity of civilization. We must work together to promote harmonious co-existence between man and Nature, build a community of all life on the Earth, and create a clean and beautiful world for us all.— We need to build global consensus on biodiversity protection, jointly work for the conclusion of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and identify targets and pathways for global biodiversity protection.— We need to push forward the global process of biodiversity protection, turn ambitions into action, support developing countries in capacity-building, and coordinate efforts to address climate change, biodiversity loss and other global challenges.— We need to promote green development through biodiversity protection, speed up the green transition of development modes and lifestyle, and leverage the Global Development Initiative (GDI) to deliver greater benefits to people of all countries.— We need to uphold a fair and equitable global order on biodiversity protection, firmly defend true multilateralism, firmly support the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law, and form strong synergy for protecting the Earth, our common homeland.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,China has made active efforts to promote ecological progress and biodiversity protection. We have continuously strengthened biodiversity mainstreaming, applied a system of ecological conservation red lines, established a protected areas system with national parks as the mainstay, carried out major biodiversity protection projects, and conducted most stringent enforcement and supervision. A large number of rare and endangered species have been placed under effective protection, and the diversity, stability and sustainability of the ecosystem have kept improving. We have found a path of biodiversity protection with Chinese characteristics.Going forward, China will continue to advance ecological progress, and plan its development in the context of promoting harmonious co-existence between man and Nature. We will respond to the Action Plan for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and launch a large number of key projects on biodiversity protection and restoration.

                Your Excellency Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to attend the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 (G77) and China. We highly commend Pakistan for its chairmanship in rallying developing countries behind the cooperative and productive efforts in tackling crises and challenges.The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. The COVID-19 keeps resurging. The world economy faces downward pressure. Geopolitical environment remains tense. And food and energy crises are compounded with one another. Developing countries are bearing the brunt of all this, and should therefore act hand in hand in response.Under these new circumstances, the G77 and China, as the most important multilateral cooperation platform for developing countries, are expected to shoulder more responsibilities and embrace greater opportunities. We should hold higher the banner of cooperation, stay committed to our original aspiration for strength through unity, carry forward our traditional partnerships, and nurture the pioneering spirit. We should keep pace with the changing times and rise up to the challenges to safeguard and expand the common interest of developing countries and the whole world. To this end, China would like to offer four proposals.First, we should keep development as a priority in international cooperation. It is important to adhere to the people-centered development approach, accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and jointly strive for important deliverables of the 2023 SDG Summit, the Third South Summit, and the High Level Dialogue on Financing for Development.Second, we should promote more inclusive, balanced and sustainable economic recovery. It is imperative to build a global partnership for economic recovery, expand the production and distribution of COVID vaccines and medicines in the developing world, support food market stability and energy accessibility for developing countries, and help developing countries achieve sustained economic recovery. Developed countries should deliver on their official development assistance and climate financing commitments. Multilateral development banks and commercial creditors have the obligation to participate in debt suspension for developing countries.Third, we should promote just and equitable global economic governance. It is vital to practice true multilateralism, safeguard the international order underpinned by international law, protect the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, and ensure stable and smooth industrial and supply chains. We must oppose unilateralism, hegemonism, group politics, and bloc confrontation. We should continue to urge the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions to increase the representation and voice of developing countries. And we should continue to support the African Union in joining the G20.Fourth, we should forge global synergy for achieving modernization at a faster pace. The population of the G77 and China accounts for over 85 percent of the world's total. Our modernization will be the most significant event that will change the history of mankind and steer the world in a more stable, balanced and prosperous direction. We should actively engage in exchanges and cooperation in economic development, deepen economic and trade ties, and better coordinate our development. We should share our experience in development, and support each other in exploring the path to modernization suited to our respective national conditions.Colleagues,China is always a staunch advocate for and active contributor to global development. President Xi Jinping put forth the Global Development Initiative (GDI) at the United Nations General Assembly last year, and called for making global development more inclusive, resilient and beneficial to all at the G20 Summit this year, pointing the way forward for global development in the new era. China will vigorously act on the initiatives made by President Xi Jinping, and join hands with the G77 to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in a bid to build a community with a shared future for mankind.We will create China opportunities" for global common development. As the world's second largest consumer market, second largest source of foreign investment and major trading partner of over 130 countries and regions, China will promote high-level opening up and accelerate efforts to foster a new development paradigm. Through the Chinese path to modernization, we will create more development opportunities and share more fruits of development with the world, especially developing countries.We will instill more "China impetus" into international development cooperation. China will continue to deeply engage in South-South cooperation, actively support international cooperation in food and energy security, development financing and climate change, work for further development of international development agencies, mobilize more development resources, and join hands with other countries to prevail over risks and challenges together.We will offer "China solutions" on ways of supporting developing countries. China has announced 32 steps to implement the GDI. More G77 members are welcome to join the Group of Friends of the GDI to jointly forge a united, equal, balanced and inclusive global development partnership.Colleagues,China is always a member of the developing world, and will always be on the side of developing countries. China will remain a sincere friend and reliable partner of our fellow developing countries, always firmly support and stand together with the G77, and stay committed to realizing our common development and rejuvenation and an even brighter future for mankind.Thank you!
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony ofThe First China-Arab States SummitRiyadh, 9 December 2022Distinguished Colleagues,Friends,Good afternoon!At the outset, I wish to thank Saudi Arabia for the warm hospitality and thoughtful arrangement. I am very pleased to join you for the first China-Arab States Summit. The Summit is a milestone in the history of China-Arab relations, and will take us to a more promising future of friendship and cooperation.China and Arab states enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges. We have come to know and befriend each other through the ancient Silk Road. We have shared weal and woe in our respective struggles for national liberation. We have conducted win-win cooperation in the tide of economic globalization. And we have upheld fairness and justice in the changing international environment. Together, China and Arab states have nurtured the spirit of friendship featuring “solidarity and mutual assistance, equality and mutual benefit, and inclusiveness and mutual learning”.Solidarity and mutual assistance is a distinct feature of China-Arab friendship. We trust each other, and have forged a brotherly friendship. We firmly support each other on issues involving our respective core interests. We work hand in hand and make progress together to realize the dream of national rejuvenation. We brave wind and storms together in fighting the COVID pandemic. The China-Arab future-oriented strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development is unbreakable.Equality and mutual benefit is a constant driver for our friendship. China and Arab states have set an example for South-South cooperation in pursuing mutually beneficial collaboration. The two sides have established 17 cooperation mechanisms under the framework of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum. Over the past decade, our trade has grown by US$100 billion, with the total volume exceeding US$300 billion; China’s direct investment in Arab states was up by 2.6 times, with the stock of investment reaching US$23 billion; over 200 Belt and Road projects have been carried out, benefiting nearly two billion people of the two sides.Inclusiveness and mutual learning is a key value inherent in our friendship. We appreciate each other’s civilizations, and have written a splendid history of mutual learning. We keep drawing wisdom from each other’s time-honored civilizations, and jointly promote “peace, harmony, integrity, and truth”, the very essence of civilization. We stay true to our principles despite the clamour for “clash of civilizations”, advocate together inter-civilizational dialogue, oppose discrimination against particular civilizations, and endeavor to safeguard the diversity of world civilizations.Colleagues,Friends,The world today is in a new period of turbulence and transformation. The Middle East is undergoing new and profound changes. The aspiration of the Arab people for peace and development is much more compelling, and their call for equity and justice is stronger than ever. As strategic partners, China and Arab states should carry forward the spirit of China-Arab friendship, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and foster a closer China-Arab community with a shared future, so as to deliver greater benefits to our peoples and advance the cause of human progress.— We should stay independent and defend our common interests. China supports Arab states in independently exploring development paths suited to their national conditions and holding their future firmly in their own hands. China is ready to deepen strategic mutual trust with Arab states, and firmly support each other in safeguarding sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity. Our two sides should jointly uphold the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, practice true multilateralism, and defend the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.— We should focus on economic development and promote win-win cooperation. We should strengthen synergy between our development strategies, and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We should consolidate cooperation in traditional areas including economy and trade, energy and infrastructure development. In the meantime, we should strengthen new sources of growth such as green and low-carbon development, health and medical services, and investment and finance, and expand new frontiers including aviation and aerospace, digital economy and peaceful use of nuclear energy. We should also tackle major challenges like food security and energy security. China will work with the Arab side to implement the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and drive sustainable development of South-South cooperation.— We should uphold regional peace and strive for common security. China supports the Arab side in promoting political settlement of hotspot and challenging issues with Arab wisdom, and build a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security architecture in the Middle East. China urges the international community to respect the role of the Middle East people as masters of their own affairs, and add positive energy to the security and stability of the region. China welcomes the Arab side to participate in the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and will continue to contribute Chinese wisdom to promoting peace and tranquility in the Middle East.— We should increase exchanges among civilizations to enhance mutual understanding and trust. We need to increase personnel exchange, deepen people-to-people cooperation, and promote the exchange of governance experience. We need to jointly oppose Islamophobia, carry out cooperation on deradicalization, and reject association of terrorism with any particular ethnic group or religion. We need to advocate humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and set an example of inter-civilizational exchanges and mutual learning in the new era.We are pleased to see the decision by the Summit to build a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era and to formulate the Outline of the Comprehensive Cooperation Plan Between China and Arab States, laying out the blueprint for future China-Arab relations. As the first follow-up step of that decision, China will, in the next three to five years, work with the Arab side to advance eight major cooperation initiatives in areas including development support, food security, public health, green innovation, energy security, inter-civilizational dialogue, youth development, and security and stability. China has briefed the Arab side on the details of the eight initiatives, and will work with the Arab side to promote their early implementation and strive for early harvest.Colleagues,Friends,The Palestinian issue bears on peace and stability in the Middle East. The historical injustices done to the Palestinian people should not be left unattended indefinitely. The legitimate rights and interests of a nation are not up for trade, and the demand to establish an independent state shall not be denied. The international community should stay firm in its commitment to the two-state solution and the principle of “land for peace”, make resolute efforts to promote peace talks, provide more humanitarian and development assistance to Palestine, and strive for a just settlement of the Palestinian issue at an early date. Recently, through the efforts of Arab states, important progress has been made in Intra-Palestinian reconciliation. China welcomes these developments. I would like to reiterate that China firmly supports the establishment of an independent State of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with east Jerusalem as its capital. China supports Palestine in becoming a full member of the United Nations, and will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine, support livelihood projects in the country, and increase donations to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Colleagues,Friends,Recently, the Communist Party of China successfully convened its 20th National Congress. The Congress laid out the tasks and path of advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through Chinese modernization, and provided a blueprint for China’s future development. China will stay committed to upholding world peace, promoting common development, and building a community with a shared future for mankind. China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and upholding international fairness and justice. China is committed to promoting friendship and cooperation with other countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and will work to deepen and expand global partnerships. Acting on a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, China will continue to promote high-standard opening up and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. By doing so, we wish to create new opportunities for Arab states and all other countries with China’s new development.Colleagues,Friends,A great cause begins with a dream and turns into reality through hard work. Let us carry forward the spirit of China-Arab friendship, jointly build a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era, and usher in an even brighter future for our relations.Thank you!
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the China-GCC SummitRiyadh, 9 December 2022Distinguished Colleagues,Secretary General Dr. Nayef Falah Al Hajraf, Good afternoon!At the outset, I wish to express heartfelt appreciation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting the China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit. It gives me great pleasure to join you in planning for the future of China-GCC relations. The friendly exchange between China and GCC countries goes back nearly two millennia in history. Throughout those years, the two peoples interacted with each other continuously along the ancient Silk Road inspired by the “Eastern wisdom” of peace, harmony and truth. In 1981, China established contact with the GCC upon its inception. Forty plus years on, the two sides have written together a splendid chapter of solidarity, mutual assistance and win-win cooperation. The leapfrog growth of China-GCC relations is attributed to the profound mutual trust. China and GCC countries have all along supported each other’s sovereignty and independence, respected each other’s development paths, upheld equality between countries regardless of their size, and stood firm in defending multilateralism. The leapfrog growth is attributed to the high degree of complementarity. China has a vast consumer market and a complete industrial system, while the GCC, with rich energy and resources, is embracing diversified economic development. This makes the two sides natural partners of cooperation.The leapfrog growth is attributed to the empathy of the two peoples. Both belonging to the family of Eastern civilizations, China and GCC countries have similar culture and values. And the peoples enjoy close bonds of friendship. The leapfrog growth is also attributed to the solidarity between the two sides in times of adversity. Against regional and international uncertainties as well as challenges such as the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and major natural disasters, the two sides have come to each other’s aid and navigated through the difficulties together.Colleagues, In response to the profound changes unseen in a century, GCC countries have strengthened themselves through unity, achieved economic growth despite COVID-19, and worked vigorously for political settlement of regional hotspots and thorny issues. They have made the GCC the most dynamic regional organization in the Middle East and the Gulf. China highly commends you for all this. Standing at a historical crossroads, we should carry forward the tradition of China-GCC friendship, and take the establishment of the China-GCC strategic partnership as an opportunity to enrich the strategic substance of this relationship.— We should be partners for greater solidarity. We need to further consolidate political mutual trust and firmly support each other’s core interests. We need to jointly uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, practice true multilateralism, and defend the common interests of all developing countries. — We should be partners for common development. We need to better synergize development strategies and leverage our respective strengths to cultivate driving forces for development. China looks forward to working with all parties to advance and implement the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and follow through on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with a view to promoting regional development and prosperity.— We should be partners for common security. China will continue to firmly support GCC countries in safeguarding their security, and support the efforts by regional countries to resolve differences through dialogue and consultation and to build a Gulf collective security architecture. China welcomes the participation of GCC countries in the Global Security Initiative (GSI) in a joint effort to uphold regional peace and stability.— We should be partners for cultural prosperity. We need to enhance interactions between our peoples, increase cultural exchanges, draw on each other’s fine cultural achievements, and promote the rich values of Eastern civilizations, so as to contribute our share to the development and progress of human civilizations.Colleagues,In the next three to five years, China is ready to work with GCC countries in the following priority areas:First, setting up a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation. China will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long-term basis from GCC countries, and purchase more LNG. We will strengthen our cooperation in the upstream sector, engineering services, as well as storage, transportation and refinery of oil and gas. The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade. The two sides will work more closely on clean and low-carbon technologies involving hydrogen, energy storage, wind and photovoltaic power and smart power grids, as well as localized production of new energy equipment. We will jointly establish a China-GCC forum on peaceful use of nuclear technology and a China-GCC nuclear security demonstration center. China will provide 300 training opportunities to GCC countries on peaceful use of nuclear energy and technology.Second, making new progress in finance and investment cooperation. China and GCC countries could collaborate on financial regulation and facilitate the entry into China’s capital market for GCC companies. China will work with the GCC to set up a joint investment commission and support cooperation between sovereign wealth funds from both sides in various forms. The two sides could explore setting up a China-GCC forum on industrial and investment cooperation, strengthen investment cooperation on digital economy and green development, and build a working mechanism on investment and economic cooperation. The two sides could start currency swap cooperation, deepen digital currency cooperation and advance the m-CBDC Bridge project.Third, expanding new areas of cooperation on innovation, science and technology. China is ready to build big data and cloud computing centers with GCC countries, strengthen 5G and 6G technology cooperation, build together innovation and entrepreneurship incubators, and implement ten digital economy projects in such areas as cross-border e-commerce and communications network. A China-GCC cooperation mechanism in meteorological science and technology will be set up, and the two sides could convene a seminar on climate response.Fourth, seeking new breakthroughs in aerospace cooperation. China will carry out a string of cooperation projects with GCC countries in remote sensing and communications satellite, space utilization, and aerospace infrastructure. The two sides could select and train astronauts together, and China welcomes GCC astronauts to its space station for joint missions and space science experiments with their Chinese colleagues. China welcomes GCC countries’ participation in payloads cooperation in its aerospace missions including Chang’e and Tianwen, and will consider establishing a China-GCC joint center for lunar and deep space exploration.Fifth, nurturing new highlights in language and cultural cooperation. China will cooperate with 300 universities, middle and primary schools in GCC countries on Chinese language education, work with GCC countries to set up 300 Chinese language smart classrooms, provide 3,000 “Chinese Bridge” summer/winter camp opportunities, and set up Chinese language learning and testing centers and online Chinese classes. The two sides could hold a China-GCC language and culture forum, and compile a bilingual library for people-to-people and cultural exchanges and mutual learning.Colleagues, China and GCC countries share the glorious mission of developing and revitalizing our nations. Our relations are both time-honored and young. Let us build on our achievements and work together to deliver an even brighter future of China-GCC relations.Thank you.
                

                Comrades and friends!Today, we hold the grand memorial meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to mourn our beloved Comrade Jiang Zemin with deep feeling of grief.At this moment, the people in Party and government organs, enterprises and institutions, villages, schools, armed forces, and urban neighborhoods across the country, the staff with Chinese embassies and consulates as well as institutions stationed abroad, compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Macao SAR, and Taiwan region, as well as overseas Chinese, are together with us to cherish the memories of Comrade Jiang's great achievements and outstanding qualities, and to express our grief.The whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups are in profound grief for the loss of such a great man as Comrade Jiang Zemin. People and leaders from all over the world and international friends in various fields have also expressed their heartfelt condolences.Comrade Jiang was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, a long-tested communist fighter, and an outstanding leader of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He was the core of the Party's third generation of central collective leadership and the principal founder of the Theory of Three Represents.We hold Comrade Jiang in high esteem and cherish the memories of him, because he devoted his whole life and energy to the Chinese people, he fought all his life for the national independence, the liberation of the people, and the realization of national prosperity and the people's wellbeing.In particular, the great achievements made by the Party and the country in the 13 years after the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1989 are inseparable from the great talent and vision as well as superb political leadership Comrade Jiang displayed, and the key role he played. Comrade Jiang made immortal feats for the Party and the people, which has won him the heartfelt love of the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and wide acclaim from the international community.Comrades and friends!Ever since his adolescent years, Comrade Jiang committed himself to seek the truth and took an active part in the people's revolutionary movements. A native of Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, he was born in the family of a patriotic intellectual in August 1926, and was enlightened by patriotism and ideas of democratic revolution from a young age. He participated in the patriotic and progressive student movements led by underground CPC organizations in the winter of 1943, joined the Party in April 1946, and since then devoted his whole life to the Party and the people.After the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Comrade Jiang worked in enterprises, scientific research institutions, and state ministries and commissions. In every post, he fulfilled his duty and worked hard, dedicated his life to the socialist revolution and construction, and did a lot of pioneering work in reform and opening up. He was elected member of the CPC Central Committee at the 12th CPC National Congress.After 1985, Comrade Jiang served as mayor of Shanghai, deputy secretary and then secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee. He led the formulation of the economic development and urban construction plans of Shanghai, put forward the development policy of building Shanghai into an open, multi-functional and highly civilized modern socialist city with rational industrial structure and advanced science and technology by the end of the 20th century. He emphasized building Pudong into an international, pivotal and modern world-class new urban district. He also actively promoted the institutional arrangements to address the people's practical concerns, and made outstanding contributions to breaking new ground in Shanghai's reform, opening up and socialist modernization. He was elected member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the first plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee.In the late spring and early summer of 1989, a severe political disturbance took place in China. Comrade Jiang upheld and implemented the CPC Central Committee's correct decision on taking a clear stand against the turmoil, defending China's socialist state power and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people, and effectively maintained the stability of Shanghai by relying on the solid support of Party members, officials and residents.Comrades and friends!In June 1989, Comrade Jiang was elected member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and general secretary of the CPC Central Committee at the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee. In November 1989, it was decided at the fifth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee that Jiang served as chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the CPC, and the Party's third generation of central collective leadership with Comrade Jiang at its core was established as a result.Comrade Jiang assumed the main leadership positions of the Party and the military when our country was facing serious external pressure and internal difficulties, and his appointment can be described as being at a critical time. Comrade Jiang had said firmly: "For the cause of the Party and the people, I would dedicate myself to my work and spare no effort until my last day."Between the late 1980s and the early 1990s, severe political disturbances erupted in the international arena and in China. The development of socialism in the world experienced serious twists and turns. Some Western countries imposed so-called sanctions on China, and the development of China's socialist cause faced unprecedented difficulties and pressures. At this historic juncture critical to the future and destiny of the Party and the state, Comrade Jiang led the central collective leadership of the CPC, firmly relying on the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, in making achievements in the following areas: unswervingly taking economic development as the central task, unequivocally upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, adhering to reform and opening-up, resolutely working on rectifications for better governance, comprehensively strengthening ideological work, carried out in-depth Party building and the fight against corruption, strengthening the ties between the Party and the people, and actively waging diplomatic struggle, resolutely safeguarding national independence, dignity, security and stability. All these safeguarded the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. As a result, the situation for the reform and development was stabilized and a solid foundation laid for China's development.During the 13 years between the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee and the 16th CPC National Congress, China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive unfolded with great momentum amid a highly volatile international situation. In a complex environment both abroad and at home, Comrade Jiang led the central collective leadership in holding high the great banners of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, unswervingly adhering to the Party's basic line and uniting the Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.He put forward the basic policy of seizing opportunities to deepen reform, further open up, promote development and maintain stability. He expounded on the 12 major relationships that should properly handled in the development of socialist modernization, which deepened our understanding of the laws that underlies socialist modernization. Stressing the importance of never letting opportunities to slip through our fingers, blazing new trails rather than following the beaten track, he led the Party in formulating and implementing a series of guidelines, policies and major strategies to promote reform, development and stability.He led the establishment of the basic program of the Party for the primary stage of socialism, which provided strong guidance for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.Comrade Jiang led us in defining building a socialist market economy as an objective of reform and set a basic framework in this regard, led the establishment of a basic economic system for the primary stage of socialism under which public ownership is the mainstay and diverse forms of ownership develop together, as well as an income distribution system under which distribution according to work is the mainstay while multiple forms of distribution exist alongside, and led us in forging ahead with reforms in the economic, political and cultural systems and other fields.Jiang had forward-looking strategic thinking on building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realizing the third-step strategic objectives for the modernization drive, noting that in the first two decades of the 21st century, efforts should be concentrated on fully building a moderately prosperous society of a higher standard for the benefit of more than 1 billion people.He stressed that prosperity provided a nation with a greater say in international arena while backwardness made it vulnerable to attack, and it was imperative for the Party to give top priority to development for governing and rejuvenating the country, focusing wholeheartedly on developing the economy.He proposed to insist on the combination of "bringing in investment" and "going global" to promote reform and development by opening up. He led China in joining the World Trade Organization, which helped setting a new stage for opening up.  He led us in developing socialist democracy, implementing the basic strategy of law-based governance, developing advanced socialist culture, realizing the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao, pushing for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to reach the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, and vigorously carrying out the major struggles against secession and "Taiwan independence".He remained committed to gain insights into the general trend of the world situation with a global vision, put forward a series of ideas on diplomatic and international strategies, actively promoted the building of a multipolar world, pushed for greater democracy in international relations, respected the diversity of the world, promoted the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and led us in breaking new ground on China’s diplomatic front.He noted that a good job of governing the Party is a prerequisite to a good job of governing the country, and the Party must be governed as strictly as possible. He underscored the commitment to theoretical study, political integrity and rectitude, and proposed to advance the great new project of Party building. He stressed the need to solve the two historical issues of improving the Party’s leadership and governance and reinforcing its ability to resist corruption and ward off risks. He stressed the need to unswervingly improve the Party conduct, build integrity and combat corruption, and always maintain the vigor and vitality, dashing spirit and integrity of communists, and thus ensure the Party’s purity and advanced nature.He led us in correctly handling the relationship between reform, development and stability, making impressive and new progress in material, political and cultural-ethical advancement and the Party building, and successfully advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century.Comrade Jiang, with a thorough understanding of the trend of the world’s new military transformation, presided over the formulation of the military strategic policy for the new period and emphasized the need to advance military transformation with Chinese characteristics, unswervingly follow a distinctive Chinese approach of having fewer but better troops, make the people's armed forces more revolutionary, modern and standardized.Jiang once said: "To put it in a nutshell, the issue I have focused my attention on over the years is whether our army can fight to win while never degrade in character."He stressed that the Party's absolute leadership over the military must be unswervingly upheld, and emphasized that the troops must be qualified politically, competent militarily, and have good conduct, strict discipline, and strong logistical support. They must preserve the nature and the character of the military as the people's armed forces, make winning local wars in the information age the focal point in preparation for military struggle and accelerate the development of national defense as well as weaponry and equipment.He also made the strategic decision that the military, armed police forces and judicial, procuratorial and public security organs must be stopped from engaging in business activities. Under his leadership and efforts, great achievements had been made in modernizing China's national defense and military.Committed to emancipation of mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times and respecting the practice and the people, Comrade Jiang put forward a series of new ideas, viewpoints and judgments on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made outstanding contributions to upholding and developing the Party’s basic theory, line, program and the accumulation of experience.In particular, by pooling the wisdom of the whole Party, he formulated the Theory of Three Represents, which further answers the questions of what socialism is and how to build it, and creatively addresses what kind of Party to build and how to build it. The theory has deepened our understanding of rules to advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthen Party building under the new conditions. With new ideas, viewpoints and judgments, it serves as a continuation, enrichment and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.In the 13 years since the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Jiang led us in calmly dealing with a series of international emergencies concerning China's sovereignty and security, overcoming difficulties and risks cropping up in the political and economic spheres and those brought by natural disasters, in particular successfully coping with the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and winning a victory in the disaster relief efforts during the heavy floods in 1998, as a result, navigating China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization in the right direction.Comrade Jiang attached great importance to the major strategic issues that were vital to the cause of the Party and the people. When preparing for the 16th CPC National Congress, Jiang proposed that he would no longer serve in the leading posts of the Party and that he would retire from the CPC Central Committee to facilitate the leadership transition of the Party and the state. The CPC Central Committee accepted his proposal. In 2004, he offered to retire from his posts as chairman of the CMC of the CPC and chairman of the CMC of the PRC, fully displaying his great foresight for the development of the cause of the Party and the state.After retiring from leadership posts, Comrade Jiang firmly upheld and support the work of the CPC Central Committee. He cared for the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and resolutely supported the efforts to improve Party conduct and combat corruption. In 2006, Jiang was personally in charge of compiling and finalizing the first, second and third volumes of "Selected Works of Jiang Zemin." The works are a major textbook that people can use to learn and advance the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the great new project of Party building.Comrade Jiang developed a distinctive revolutionary spirit and demeanor in the long period of revolutionary practices. He was far-sighted, and could make correct assessments of different situations. He always observed and reflected on issues by taking into consideration the general development trends of China and the world, as well as the overall work of the Party and the state, continuously advancing theoretical innovation and innovation in other fields. Jiang was firm in his convictions and decisive in actions. He always put the Party and the people first, and unswervingly adhered to the ideals and beliefs of communists. At critical moments, Jiang had the great courage to make resolute decisions and theoretical innovation. Jiang valued practice and kept pace with the times. He always grasped the trends and opportunities of the times, summing up experience and seeking new ways based on the vibrant practice of the Party and the people, thus advancing the work of the Party and the state in a down-to-earth yet enterprising manner. Jiang respected and cared for the people, always paying close attention to their security and well-being, and assessing and advancing work based on the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people. His revolutionary spirit and demeanor will forever be remembered, and will educate and motivate us to stride forward.Jiang's death is an inestimable loss to the CPC, the Chinese military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. The CPC Central Committee calls on the whole Party, the entire military and the people of all ethnic groups to turn grief into strength, carry forward Jiang's legacy and express grief with concrete actions, and continue to write new chapters in the development of the cause of the Party and the state on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology, on which our Party and country are founded and thrive. The most valuable asset that Comrade Jiang has left us is the Theory of Three Represents. "I raised this theory after a long period of reflection," he said. "The Theory of Three Represents did not come out of thin air, but out of our constant exploration and pioneering in theory and practice over the past 13 years." The Theory of Three Represents is the guiding principle that the Party must uphold for a long time to come. On our new journey, we must continue to adapt the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and fine traditional culture. We must proceed from reality in all matters, and constantly respond to the questions posed by China, by the world, by the people and by the times, so as to maintain the vigor and vitality of Marxism.The leadership of the CPC offers a fundamental guarantee for the Party and the people to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of the socialist cause. Comrade Jiang once said from the bottom of his heart: "As a veteran CPC member, I sincerely hope that all of us in the Party, especially those in the central leadership, put the Party first and consciously uphold and safeguard the Party leadership in all fields of work. This is where the hope of the Party and the country lies." On the new journey, we must always keep sober-minded and determined. We must strengthen the Four Consciousnesses, reinforce the Four-Sphere Confidence, and ensure the Two Upholds. We must carry forward the great founding spirit of the Party, stay true to our founding mission, have the courage to advance self-reform, to ensure that the Party always serves as the strong leadership core in the course of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics will allow China to catch up with the times in great strides and play a leading role. In his speech at the ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of the CPC in 2001, Comrade Jiang stressed that the 80-year practice had taught us that we must unswervingly adhere to our own path, which was the most essential experience we had obtained in summing up our Party's history. On the new journey, we must follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, stick to the Party's basic theory, line and policy, stay confident and build strength, uphold fundamental principles and break new ground, stride forward on the correct path we have chosen to advance national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to modernization.The people are the fundamental force that determines the future of the Party and the country. Comrade Jiang remained loyal to the people and kept the people in mind. He called for a people-oriented approach and stressed several times that "The interests of the overwhelming majority of the people are the vital and most decisive factor. This is a fundamental viewpoint of Marxism," urging us to always strive to realize, safeguard, and advance the fundamental interests of the people. On the new journey, we must put the people first, serve the people wholeheartedly, further implement the people-centered philosophy of development, develop whole-process people's democracy, maintain a close bond with the people, breathe the same air as the people, share the same future and stay truly connected to them, to make more notable and substantive progress in promoting the people's well-rounded development and prosperity for all.Reform and opening up is a key move that has determined the future and destiny of contemporary China. Comrade Jiang emphasized: "We should promote institutional, scientific, cultural innovation and innovation in other aspects through theoretical innovation, explore ways to advance in practice, and never become complacent or slack off, and this is the way to govern the Party and the country for a long time to come." On the new journey, we must accurately identify changes, adeptly respond to them, and work to steer them in our favor. We must implement the new development philosophy, create a new development pattern, promote high-quality development, and comprehensively advance reform and opening up. We must continue to improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, advance the modernization of China's system and capacity for governance, so as to gain the edge, seize the initiative and embrace the future.China cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world, nor can the world achieve prosperity without China. Comrade Jiang stressed that we must adjust ourselves to the historical trends, promote the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order, strive for a long-term peaceful international environment, safeguard China's national security and interests in an all-round way, and continue to make new and greater contributions to the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind. On the new journey, we must bear in mind the interest of the world, hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and advocate the common values of mankind. We must promote high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, advance the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind, and move forward hand in hand with all progressive forces in the world.Having the courage to fight and the fortitude to win is what has made our Party and the Chinese people invincible. Comrade Jiang stressed: "Our Party is leading the people in the great struggle to build socialist modernization, we will inevitably encounter many complicated circumstances, and severe situations at home and abroad, and confrontations and struggles between different social systems and ideologies are often a test for every Party member." "We must be heroic enough to overwhelm all enemies" and "one cannot bow his or her noble head." On the new journey, we must race against the time and strive for success, uphold a fighting spirit to rise to difficulties. We must grasp the historical initiative, foster a firmer sense of purpose, fortitude, and self-belief in the whole Party and among the Chinese people of all ethnic groups so that we are not swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation and cowed by pressure, and thus dig deep to overcome all difficulties and challenges on the road ahead.Comrades and friends!Comrade Jiang Zemin has parted from us forever. But his name and reputation, deeds of merit, thoughts, and outstanding qualities will go down in history and remain immortal in the hearts of the people for generations to come. The whole Party, the military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, forge ahead with enterprise and fortitude, and strive in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.Eternal glory to Comrade Jiang Zemin!
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 29th APEC Economic Leaders’MeetingBangkok, 18 November 2022Your Excellency Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to join you in Bangkok, the beautiful City of Angels. This is our first face-to-face meeting since the onset of COVID-19. I wish to extend our hearty appreciation to the government of Thailand, and Prime Minister Prayut in particular, for putting this meeting together.At present, the COVID-19 pandemic still drags on with cases surging here and there. Global recovery is facing multiple challenges. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. Global industrial and supply chains are under stress. Problems such as inflation and food and energy security remain intricate and challenging.The Asia-Pacific is our home as well as the powerhouse of global economic growth. Over the past decades, robust economic cooperation in the region has created the “Asia-Pacific miracle” admired across the world. Asia-Pacific cooperation has taken deep roots in the hearts of the people.Today the world has come to another historical crossroads, and this has made the Asia-Pacific region even more important and prominent in its standing and role.As an ancient Chinese sage observed, “The wise are free from doubts, the benevolent from anxiety, and the brave from fear.” Facing the new circumstances, we must join hands together to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and take Asia-Pacific cooperation to a new height. To this end, I wish to propose the following.First, we should uphold international fairness and justice and build an Asia-Pacific of peace and stability. The region owes decades of its rapid growth to a peaceful and stable environment. This attests to the critical importance of mutual respect, solidarity and cooperation, and consultation among all parties for the greatest denominator when something comes up. We should always assume the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. No one should interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, and everyone should respect the development path and social system chosen independently by the people of each country. We should take seriously the legitimate security concerns of every country, and promote peaceful settlement of differences and disputes among countries through dialogue and consultation. We should take an active part in global governance and make the international order more just and reasonable to ensure peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.Second, we should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness and bring about prosperity for all in the Asia-Pacific. History has proven time and again that only openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation is the right way forward for humanity. We need to continue pursuing open regionalism, strengthen coordination on macroeconomic policies, forge more closely linked regional supply and industrial chains, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and steadily advance regional economic integration for the early realization of a high-standard Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. We need to make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people, and we should promote prosperity for all in the Asia-Pacific. China will work with other parties on the full and high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and continue working toward joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), for the purpose of promoting integrated development of the region. China will consider holding the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation next year to provide fresh impetus for the development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific and the world.Third, we should always strive for green and low-carbon development and ensure a clean and beautiful Asia-Pacific. Protecting the ecological environment and tackling climate change is a common challenge facing all humanity. We need to enhance economic and technical cooperation, speed up coordinated digital and green development, advance the transition and upgrading of energy, resources, and industrial and consumption structures, and promote green economic and social development. This year we jointly formulated the Bangkok Goals on Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy, which aims to advance ecological and environmental protection and economic development in a coordinated way. China will provide support for its implementation. Last year at the United Nations, I proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI), calling for enhanced practical cooperation in poverty reduction, food, energy, health and other areas, and urging expedited implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I welcome Asia-Pacific countries to take an active part in the Initiative.Fourth, we should bear in mind our shared future and make the Asia-Pacific a region where all are ready to help each other. We need to view Asia-Pacific cooperation from a strategic and long-term perspective, uphold APEC’s role as the main channel in regional cooperation, and keep Asia-Pacific cooperation in the right direction. We need to act on the purposes and principles of APEC, and continually deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation. We need to follow the spirit of our Asia-Pacific family, look after one another like passengers in the same boat, and steadily move toward an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future.Colleagues, Last month, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held successfully, setting the course and providing the blueprint for China’s development for now and the years to come. China is ready to pursue peaceful coexistence and common development with all countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. We will advance a broader agenda of opening up across more areas and in greater depth, follow the Chinese path to modernization, put in place new systems for a higher-standard open economy, and continue to share our development opportunities with the world, particularly with the Asia-Pacific region.As a Thai proverb goes, “You reap what you sow.” We have jointly sown the seed of the Putrajaya Vision. It is time for us to cultivate, nurture, and foster the blossoming flower of common development of the Asia-Pacific! Thank you.

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt Session I of the 17th G20 SummitBali, 15 November 2022Your Excellency President Joko Widodo,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to attend the G20 Bali Summit. At the outset, I wish to thank President Joko Widodo and the Indonesian government for making these thoughtful arrangements for the Summit. I also salute the Indonesian presidency for its important role in promoting G20 cooperation.We meet at a time of momentous changes unseen in a century, changes that are consequential to the world, to our times, and to history. The COVID-19 pandemic still drags on with cases surging here and there. The world economy is getting more fragile. The geopolitical environment remains tense. Global governance is seriously inadequate. Food and energy crises are compounded with one another. All this poses formidable challenges to our development.Faced with these challenges, it is imperative that all countries embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, and advocate peace, development, and win-win cooperation. All countries should replace division with unity, confrontation with cooperation, and exclusion with inclusiveness. All countries should join hands together to answer the question of our times — “what is wrong with this world, what we should do about it” — so as to tide over difficulties and create a better future together.All G20 members should take the responsibility inherent in being major international and regional players, and should lead by example in promoting development of all nations, improving the well-being for the whole mankind, and advancing progress of the entire world.— We should make global development more inclusive. Solidarity is strength, but division leads nowhere. Living in the same global village, we should stand with each other in the face of risks and challenges. Drawing ideological lines or promoting group politics and bloc confrontation will only divide the world, and hinder global development and human progress. With human civilization already in the 21st century, the Cold-War mentality has long been outdated. What we need to do is to join hands together and elevate our win-win cooperation to a new height.Countries should respect each other, seek common grounds while reserving differences, live together in peace, and promote an open world economy. No one should engage in beggar-thy-neighbor practices, building “a small yard with high fences”, or creating closed and exclusive clubs.I always believe that the G20 should stay committed to its founding purpose of unity and cooperation, carry forward the spirit of solidarity, and uphold the principle of consensus. “Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps.” This Indonesian proverb well captures the value of solidarity. Division and confrontation serve no one’s interest. Only solidarity and common development is the right choice to make.— We should make global development beneficial to all. Development is real only when allcountries develop together. Prosperity and stability cannot be possible in a world where the rich become richer while the poor are made poorer. Every nation aspires for a better life, and modernization is not a privilege reserved for any single country. Frontrunners in development should sincerely help others develop, and provide more global public goods. All major countries should perform their due responsibilities, and do their best for the cause of global development.The Global Development Initiative (GDI) that I proposed is aimed at meeting the long-term objective and immediate needs of common development of the world, fostering international consensus on promoting development, cultivating new drivers for global development, and facilitating common development and progress of all countries.Within one year, more than 60 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI. China has established the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, and will increase its funding for the China-UN Peace and Development Fund. We will make a list of items for practical cooperation, set up an open-ended pool of GDI projects, and draw up a roadmap for GDI implementation. We are working with 100-plus countries and international organizations on the GDI, thus providing new impetus for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has submitted 15 projects to the “G20 Action for Strong and Inclusive Recovery”, and has participated in five other projects within this framework. We will work with fellow G20 members to deliver on these projects.— We should make global development more resilient. Economic globalization is encountering headwinds, and the world economy is at risk of recession. Everyone is having a hard time, but developing countries are bearing the brunt. It is therefore more imperative than ever for us to focus on the issue of development. The theme of the Bali Summit, “Recover Together, Recover Stronger”, sends a positive message of the G20’s commitment to supporting the growth of developing countries and preventing divergent and unbalanced global recovery. We need to build a global partnership for economic recovery, prioritize development and put the people at the center, always keep in mind the difficulties faced by developing countries, and accommodate their concerns. China supports the African Union in joining the G20.All parties should continue to deepen international cooperation against COVID-19, and raise the accessibility and affordability of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostic and treatment methods in developing countries so as to create a sound environment for economic recovery. We should curb global inflation, and defuse systemic economic and financial risks. In particular, developed economies should mitigate the negative spillovers from their monetary policy adjustment, and keep their debts at sustainable levels. The IMF should speed up the on-lending of SDRs to low-income countries. International financial institutions and commercial creditors, which are the main creditors of developing countries, should take part in the debt reduction and suspension for developing countries. China is implementing the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in all respects, and has suspended the largest amount of debt service payment among all G20 members. Meanwhile, China is working with some G20 members on the debt treatment under the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI, thus helping relevant developing countries navigate through the difficult time.Global trade, digital economy, green transition and fighting corruption are key factors driving global development. We should continue to uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, actively push forward WTO reform, enhance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and promote an open world economy. China has proposed the G20 Action Plan on Digital Innovation and Cooperation. We look forward to working with all parties to foster an open, fair, and non-discriminatory environment for digital economy so as to narrow the North-South digital divide. In tackling climate change and transitioning toward green and low-carbon development, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld. It is also important to provide funding, technology and capacity-building support for developing countries and promote cooperation on green finance. International cooperation is very important for fighting corruption. G20 members must maintain zero tolerance for corruption, step up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, and refuse to provide “safe havens” to corrupt individuals and assets.Global development would be impossible without a peaceful and stable international environment. With this in mind, I have put forward the Global Security Initiative (GSI). Our goal is to work with all parties to champion the spirit of the UN Charter, act on the principle of indivisible security, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, advocate the resolution of conflicts through negotiation and settlement of disputes through consultation, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises.Colleagues,Food and energy security is the most pressing challenge in global development. The root cause of the ongoing crises is not production or demand, but interrupted supply chains and international cooperation. The way out of this is for all countries to, with the coordination of the UN and other multilateral international organizations, enhance cooperation on market supervision and regulation, build partnerships on commodities, develop an open, stable and sustainable commodities market, and work together to unclog supply chains and stabilize market prices.We must resolutely oppose the attempt to politicize food and energy issues or use them as tools and weapons. Unilateral sanctions must be removed, and restrictions on relevant scientific and technological cooperation must be lifted. In reducing the consumption of fossil fuel energy and transitioning toward clean energy, we need to give balanced consideration to various factors, and make sure that the transitional process does not hurt the economy or people’s livelihood. Developing countries face more acute risks in food and energy security. The G20 should keep this in mind, and provide necessary support in production, collection, storage, funding and technology. Since the UN has established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, the G20 should voice its support for it.Over the years, China has made major contribution to global food and energy security. This year, China has proposed, together with six partners including Indonesia and Serbia, the Initiative of International Cooperation on Resilient and Stable Industrial and Supply Chains, joined other countries in calling for the establishment of the Global Clean Energy Cooperation Partnership, and put forward the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security in the G20. We look forward to deepening cooperation with all parties in these areas.Colleagues,The Communist Party of China has recently convened its 20th National Congress, laying out the goals, tasks and guiding policies for the cause of the Party and the country in the next five years and beyond. China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development, stay committed to deepening reform and opening-up, and stay committed to promoting national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. A China marching toward modernization will bring more opportunities to the world, inject stronger momentum for international cooperation, and make greater contribution to human progress!Thank you.
                

                Phnom Penh, November 13, 2022Prime Minister Hun Sen,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to join you in the beautiful city of Phnom Penh. I want to thank Prime Minister Hun Sen and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia for the thoughtful arrangements made for the meeting.On the remarkable journey of East Asian cooperation, the city of Phnom Penh has left its own deep mark. Ten years ago, the ASEAN Summit adopted the Phnom Penh Declaration, taking ASEAN Community building onto a fast track. It is also in Phnom Penh that negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) were officially launched. The Phnom Penh Declaration on the East Asia Summit Development Initiative pooled consensus among all parties and created a strong momentum for common development in the region. Today, we are again gathered in Phnom Penh for the first face-to-face East Asia Summit (EAS) since COVID-19 struck. This is a meeting of great significance. China hopes to work with all parties to generate new dynamism for regional prosperity and development.Today, the international and regional landscapes are intricate and complex; the world economic recovery remains sluggish; the international security situation is less than stable; and energy, food and financial risks and challenges keep flaring up. That said, we must see that our region has maintained peace and stability on the whole, regional economic integration continues to move ahead, a stable system of industrial and supply chains has taken shape, the idea of green development has taken deep root, and digital transformation has become a new area of growth. The call for peace and development among people in the region is growing stronger. Countries in the region need to uphold mutual respect, deepen win-win cooperation, and tackle risks and challenges together. With a membership covering major economies in the Asia-Pacific, the EAS enjoys broad-based representation and influence. The EAS should keep to the right direction amid shifting dynamics in the region and beyond, and stick to its defined role. It should enhance institution building, expand common ground , strengthen its foundation, and boost the driving force of the two wheels of development and security. At the EAS, all parties need to share opportunities, tackle challenges together, deepen regional cooperation, and make positive contributions to longstanding peace, stability and prosperity in the region.First, we need to maintain strategic dialogue and conduct constructive interactions. As a leaders-led strategic forum, the EAS has, since its inception, stressed the need to uphold the spirit of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and the ASEAN Way of accommodating each other’s comfort levels. The EAS has served as an important platform for regional countries to have exchange and cooperation on political and security affairs and economic development. In the face of inclinations toward geopolitical tensions and escalating hotspots, the EAS should serve as a platform for dialogue to encourage engagement and consultation among regional countries to increase mutual understanding and trust, and properly manage differences. It should avoid decoupling, and still less move toward confrontation. China has put forward the Global Security Initiative which advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, presenting China’s solution to security challenges. China is ready to work with all other parties to create favorable conditions for broadening and deepening practical cooperation and to consolidate the foundation for lasting peace and stability in East Asia.Second, we need to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation and tackle risks and challenges together. Global threats and challenges call for global responses and real action is what matters most. East Asia is one of the regions that enjoy the biggest development and cooperation potential. Last year, China, Japan and the ROK and ASEAN contributed over 30 percent to global economic growth, and trade and investment within the region has sustained a momentum of fairly rapid expansion. We need to keep to the right direction of economic globalization, and continue to pursue trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and open and mutually beneficial cooperation. We need to work for sound implementation of the RCEP, keep the industrial and supply chains secure, stable and smooth, and push forward the regional economic integration process, to spur a sustainable recovery and growth in our region. In response to public health risks such as new infectious diseases, China will continue to support ASEAN in building regional vaccine production and distribution centers, and actively advance regional capacity-building on public health. To tackle energy security challenges, China believes it is imperative to pursue a balanced and orderly low-carbon transition, ensure accessible and secure energy supply to meet production and livelihood needs, and safeguard energy and food security. China welcomes the efforts by all in harnessing the mechanisms of the Clean Energy Forum and the New Energy Forum to enhance policy exchange and practical cooperation, in a joint effort to meet climate and ecological challenges, and advance sustainable development in the region. We look forward to an early renewal of the plan of action of the EAS, with greater input in practical cooperation in such areas as poverty reduction, to deliver on more development goals.Third, we need to uphold ASEAN centrality and foster an inclusive regional architecture. Over the years, a multi-tiered and inter-connected architecture of regional cooperation has taken shape in East Asia, which has played an irreplaceable role in safeguarding regional peace, stability and prosperity. The key to its success is that it upholds ASEAN centrality, accommodates the interests of all parties, and conforms to the regional reality. While the architecture may be constantly refined in light of evolving situation, ASEAN centrality as its very foundation must not be undermined. All parties should support ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation. Only in this way can East Asian cooperation be strong and sustainable. China supports continued efforts in the ASEAN Way to facilitate a proper settlement of the Myanmar issue to uphold ASEAN unity and cooperation. The international community should foster a favorable external environment to this end.Colleagues,A peaceful and stable South China Sea, and freedom of navigation and overflight there serves the interests of all parties. As the world’s biggest trader of goods, China has 60 percent of its cargoes shipped through the South China Sea. The freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea has never been a problem.Two days ago, leaders of ASEAN countries and I jointly announced the release of the Joint Statement on the 20th Anniversary of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, sending out a strong signal of our firm commitment to fully and effectively implementing the Declaration and jointly safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea. China stands for maintaining peace and stability and unimpeded sea lanes in the South China Sea. In keeping with the spirit of the DOC that has been in place for 20 years and the principles of international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to step up COC consultations on the basis of consensus-building. All sides should respect the efforts of regional countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea, and support regional countries in making the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.The achievements China has made in its economic and social development in the past four decades of reform and opening-up are attributable to a peaceful external environment and a stable region which conform to China’s interests. China follows an independent foreign policy of peace and a path of peaceful development. It decides on its position and policies based on the merits of each matter, upholds the basic norms governing international relations, and stands for international fairness and justice. China is committed to the fundamental national policy of opening-up and pursues a win-win strategy of opening-up. It will continue to bring opportunities to other countries in the world with its own development, and promote an open global economy to the betterment of people around the world. With common will and sincerity, a brighter future can be created. China is ready to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with all parties to together make East Asia, our common home, a better place, and jointly preserve peace and prosperity of the world.Thank you.
                

                Phnom Penh, November 12, 2022Your Excellency Prime Minister Hun Sen,Colleagues,I am delighted to meet you face to face at this important time of the 25th anniversary of ASEAN Plus Three (APT) cooperation. I wish to thank Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian government for all the preparations made for the meeting and express my welcome to President Yoon Suk-yeol and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to their first APT Summit.This is my tenth APT Summit. Over the past decade, China has proposed more than 130 initiatives and programs of cooperation under this framework. Thanks to our joint efforts, all have been basically implemented. In these ten years, I have also witnessed the impressive growth of APT cooperation into a tall, leafy tree, and I wish to thank you for your valuable support for China’s participation in this endeavor.Just now, we released the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation 1997-2022 in Commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of APT Cooperation, which reviewed the fruitful outcomes of this framework since its inception in 1997. Twenty-five years ago, countries in the region jointly launched the APT aiming at the invigoration and long prosperity of East Asia. Over the past 25 years, thanks to the overall peace and stability in the region, APT cooperation has maintained rapid growth and made continuous progress, which has not only boosted our respective national development, but also contributed to regional financial and food security and the stability and smooth functioning of international industrial and supply chains. We have maintained our solidarity and coordination through the trying times, stood side by side in addressing financial crises, public health emergencies, and other major risks and challenges, and jointly established various cooperation mechanisms such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM), and the ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (APTERR). These developments have provided a constant source of impetus to the stability and development of East Asia.The global and regional situations are now undergoing profound and complex changes. On the one hand, we have achieved initial success in fighting COVID-19; the East Asian economy has been recovering despite ups and downs; the reopening of the tourism sector and faster growth of the digital economy are creating important impetus. On the other hand, global security situation remains turbulent; unilateralism and protectionism are surging; economic and financial risks are rising; and global development is confronted with unprecedented challenges. As major economies in East Asia, APT countries need to stay committed to promoting peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region and beyond, and to improving the people’s wellbeing .Colleagues,East Asia is an important engine driving world economic growth. APT is the main vehicle of East Asian cooperation. We need to take its 25th anniversary as a new starting point, draw experience from history, and strengthen cooperation in a progressive spirit. We need to take the renewal of the APT Cooperation Work Plan as an opportunity to boost the momentum of cooperation and work toward the long-term goal of establishing an East Asian Community.First, we need to take forward regional economic integration. Economic integration has been a key driving force behind East Asia’s development and prosperity; it is also what countries in the region need for their development. East Asia is a major engine driving world economic growth, and accounts for nearly 30 percent of the global population, economy and trade. Closer economic cooperation in this region is required to both meet the current downward pressures and pursue development in the long run. The RCEP represents a free trade area that has the largest population, most diverse membership and greatest potential. Its entry into force and implementation is a milestone in East Asian economic integration. We need to make the most of the commitments and rules on market access, to further release its dividends. China has contributed funds to RCEP economic and technical cooperation to assist ASEAN countries in building capacity for implementing the agreement, and is ready to continue such effort. We support the early establishment of an RCEP secretariat to enhance institution building. We hope the parties will support China’s Hong Kong in joining the agreement as one of the earliest new members. We need to work together to build a more open and inclusive platform for economic cooperation, and uphold a diverse and stable international economic landscape and trade relations.Second, we need to deepen cooperation in the industrial division of labor in East Asia. As the production networks of East Asia improve, regional economies have become increasingly interdependent. Such industrial cooperation networks that have emerged over the years have long been deeply integrated, complementary and mutually beneficial. The acts of erecting walls or barriers, decoupling or disrupting supply chains are against economic laws and market principles, and are, in the final analysis, neither viable nor sustainable. International trade has never been free of frictions. Yet win-win and all-win results can be realized if these differences are put into perspective and handled fairly and equitably. We need to pursue open and inter-connected development, and upgrade regional industrial and supply chains while keeping them stable and smooth. This serves the common interests of all countries, and represents the right direction of economic globalization. In July this year, China hosted the APT Forum on Industrial Chain and Supply Chain Cooperation, which released joint cooperation initiatives expressing the common wish to keep regional industrial and supply chains stable and smooth and make them more resilient. To realize high-quality development in East Asia, we must make continued efforts for an open and innovative environment, and build a closer and more resilient regional industrial system. China will work through the ASEAN+3 SME Service Alliance to help businesses in the region build capacity for scientific and technological innovation and digital transformation, so that they can better play their role as a leading force in industrial restructuring and upgrading in the region, and create more job opportunities.Third, we need to build a stronger capacity for crisis response. In the face of multiple crises in public health, food, energy, and finance, we need to make the most of the APT crisis response mechanisms to maintain overall stability in our region, and at the same time, further enhance and develop the mechanisms to get prepared against greater risks and challenges in the future. On the development of the APT Reserve of Medical Supplies for Public Health Emergencies (RMS), China is prepared to provide assistance of medical supplies to countries in need. China supports the efforts to make the CMIM more readily available and effective, strengthen the role of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), and keep improving the regional financial safety net. China is implementing its commitment of new funding contribution to AMRO to strengthen its capacity for economic surveillance and technical assistance, and support its efforts to build a regional knowledge center and a regional financial think tank network. To better safeguard food security in our region, China will continue to make financial contribution to APTERR in the next five years to provide rice to ASEAN countries and carry out supporting activities.Fourth, we need to deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges. While the COVID-19 pandemic has affected face-to-face communication, it has also galvanized new ways of interaction such as “cloud meeting” and “cloud tourism”, enriching our people-to-people and cultural exchanges. China is ready to take the newly established ASEAN Directors-General of Immigration Departments and Heads of Consular Affairs Divisions of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs Plus Three (DGICM+3) Consultation as an opportunity, to host the Seminar on Immigration Policy of APT Countries and carry out the APT Young Police Professionals Program, in a bid to enhance the exchanges and cooperation between our immigration and law enforcement departments, and provide more policy support to personnel interflow. In keeping with the changing COVID situation, China will refine its containment protocols, gradually increase its international flights, and is ready to actively facilitate the return of ASEAN, Japanese and ROK students to China. At the same time, we need to make good use of such platforms as the Network of APT Cultural Cities to encourage and support various forms of exchanges between East Asian Cultural Cities and the ASEAN Cities of Culture. China looks forward to APT countries’ participation in the events under the Asian tourism promotion plan to strengthen practical cooperation on culture and tourism. China is ready to host the 21st East Asia Forum next year to deepen exchanges among government, industry and academia between APT countries.Fifth, we need to boost sustainable development. Embodying the people-centered development philosophy, sustainable development is crucial for the harmonious co-existence between man and nature, and is also a shared aspiration of people in East Asia. To promote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, China wishes to work with all parties to implement the Global Development Initiative, take the lead in conducting the APT research on transition finance, host the APT Clean Energy Roundtable Dialogue, and engage in green and sustainable development cooperation through the APT Inter-Bank Association, to deepen our low-carbon cooperation partnership. China has achieved a historic success in eliminating absolute poverty. We are ready to share poverty-alleviation experience with other regional countries, continue to advance the projects under the East Asian Cooperation Initiative on Poverty Reduction (phase II), and hold the APT Village Leaders Exchange Program, to help reduce poverty and promote development in the region. Human resources are a major pillar of development. We need to attach high importance to nurturing talent, with a special focus on cooperation on reopening schools and rebuilding a resilient educational system under the current circumstances, to provide intellectual support to sustainable development.China keeps to its foreign policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development. We will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and deepen friendship, mutual trust and convergence of interests with neighboring countries. Opening-up is a fundamental national policy of China. We will adhere to the win-win strategy of opening-up, keep to the right direction of economic globalization, push for trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, advance bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation, promote international coordination on macro economic policies, advance an open world economy, and work along with other countries to foster a pro-development international environment. I wish to emphasize that the Chinese economy has become an integral part of the world economy. Our development is both domestically driven and oriented toward the world. For years, China has been the world’s biggest trader in goods. Imports contribute 70 percent to China’s industrial added value. Foreign-invested companies play a big role in job creation, business start-ups, market connectivity and flow of talent. There is no reason for China to stop opening-up. The door will only open wider. China will continue to pursue high-level opening-up, expand access to its domestic market, protect the rights and interests of foreign investment, and foster a market-oriented and law-governed business environment up to international standards. Through its high-quality development and high-level opening-up, China will present new and greater development opportunities to the world, and inject new impetus into APT cooperation as well. Colleagues,APT cooperation has withstood many changing circumstances. What we have achieved in the cooperation has not come easily, and deserves to be dearly cherished. As a Cambodian proverb goes, trust grows like a tree. Facing both burgeoning opportunities and upcoming new challenges, only trust, solidarity and cooperation can lead us to win-win and all-win results against all odds. China is ready to work with other APT countries to build up consensus, deepen practical cooperation, and work tirelessly for an even better future of East Asian cooperation.Thank you! 
                

                Phnom Penh, November 11, 2022Prime Minister Hun Sen,Colleagues,It is my real pleasure to gather with you in the beautiful and vibrant city of Phnom Penh for the 25th China-ASEAN Summit. I wish to thank Prime Minister Hun Sen and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia for the thoughtful preparations and meticulous arrangements made for the summit.Since the inception of a dialogue relationship in the early 1990s, China and ASEAN have forged ahead together and been a part of each other’s success stories. With mutually beneficial cooperation advancing on all fronts and yielding fruitful outcomes, our two sides have set a fine example of win-win cooperation and common development in the region. In November last year, we held a special summit to commemorate the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations and formally inaugurated a comprehensive strategic partnership. At that summit, President Xi Jinping proposed jointly building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home. China-ASEAN relations have since come to a new historical starting point. A new and promising chapter of China-ASEAN friendship and cooperation has been opened.Our strategic cooperation has continued to reach new heights. The frequent and close high-level exchanges between China and ASEAN countries have further enriched our comprehensive strategic cooperation, which has strongly boosted the broader East Asian cooperation and led the way in common development in our region. Upholding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the purposes of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, China and ASEAN have lived in amity, treated each other as equals, resolved differences through consultation and dialogue and enjoyed deeper mutual political trust. Through closer communication and coordination, we have together kept East Asia an “oasis of peace” and made our active contributions to regional security and stability.Our pursuit of common development has gained stronger momentum. Trade between China and ASEAN has grown against the odds of COVID-19 in the past three years. We have become each other’s largest trading partners. Two-way trade has been hitting new highs and reached US$798.4 billion in the first ten months of 2022, up by 13.8 percent year-on-year. We have worked together for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to be signed and implemented, and hence built the world’s largest free trade area, taking our open and interconnected development to a new level. Our efforts to enhance connectivity have produced fruitful outcomes. The opening of the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway has taken Cambodia into a “high-speed era”. With the China-Laos railway, the Lao dream of becoming a land-linked country has come true. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, the first of its kind across ASEAN, will soon begin its trial operation. The construction of the China-Laos-Thailand railway and the Malaysia’s East Coast Rail Link is gaining traction. The China-Malaysia and China-Indonesia “Two Countries, Twin Parks” have grown bigger and stronger. The New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor has efficiently linked up Europe and Asia. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation has made iconic achievements.Our security cooperation has grown more dynamic. Cooperation on military affairs and security, including the defense ministers’ meeting, joint naval exercise and exchange programs for military officers and think tanks, has made solid progress. Practical cooperation on combating transnational crimes and on disaster prevention and relief has registered many highlights.Our people-to-people ties have become ever closer. Despite COVID-19, the momentum of our interactions both online and in person is strengthening. Orderly progress is underway for ASEAN students to return to China and resume their studies. The China-ASEAN Young Leaders Scholarship has been broadened out. Our two sides are stepping up to refine visa policies and adjusting upward the number of flights to facilitate business travels. Platforms such as the China-ASEAN Expo, the China-ASEAN Education Cooperation Week and the ASEAN-China Center have unleashed new potentials to bring our peoples closer.The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held not long ago has laid out the strategic plans for building China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts. It was underlined at the Congress that China will keep to its foreign policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development. China will remain committed to an independent foreign policy of peace, to peaceful development and to the fundamental national policy of opening-up, and work to grow friendship and cooperation with all countries.Colleagues,The regional and international environments are undergoing profound and complex changes with rising uncertainties and destabilizing factors. COVID-induced shocks are lingering, economic recovery is sluggish, the Cold War mentality is resurfacing, and multilateral governance is in disarray. Global development is facing unprecedented challenges. Peace and stability are the prerequisite for development, and a steady growth of the world economy is a pressing task for all countries. China is ready to work with all parties to uphold the UN-centered international system, practice multilateralism, promote the implementation of the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and jointly safeguard world peace and tranquility. China calls for a joint effort to increase macroeconomic policy coordination, keep industrial and supply chains secure and smooth, act on the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and deepen practical cooperation on all fronts. With solidarity and coordination, we could better meet global challenges and realize inclusive and sustainable development. China and ASEAN are comprehensive strategic partners with a shared future, and have stood together through thick and thin. Picking sides should not have to be our choice. Openness and cooperation are the viable way in meeting our common challenges. China will keep to its policy of neighborhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness as well as building friendship and partnership with its neighbors. We will continue to take ASEAN as a high priority in our neighborhood diplomacy, and firmly support ASEAN in playing an even bigger role in regional and international affairs. Now, ASEAN is working on the ASEAN Community’s Post-2025 Vision toward a people-centered and more sustainable ASEAN Community, while China is embarking on a new journey to build a modern socialist country in all respects. Modernization and achieving a better life for our people is a goal we are both working hard to attain. The new circumstances call upon us to continuously enhance friendship, deepen mutual trust and expand common interests. We need to stay focused on development and cooperation, embrace opportunities, meet challenges and pursue modernization with a sense of togetherness, advance regional economic integration and build a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future. To this end, I wish to make the following proposals:First, we need to forge a stronger consensus on development cooperation. Confronted with global difficulties and challenges, no country can be immune from their impacts. We need to put development first, better synergize our development strategies and take collective actions. We need to earnestly deliver the just released China-ASEAN Joint Statement on Strengthening Common and Sustainable Development. As we implement the Annex to the China-ASEAN Plan of Action 2021-2025: Advancing China-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, we may seize this opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of our practical cooperation. In pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, we may promote the mutually beneficial cooperation between the Belt and Road Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. China appreciates that all ASEAN countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, and will set up a special loan on China-ASEAN common development. China welcomes that our two sides have agreed on the signing of the Agreement on China-ASEAN Technical Cooperation, and will step up input in Lancang-Mekong Cooperation and China-BIMP-EAGA cooperation, to help ASEAN narrow development gaps. China has circulated the Implementation List of China-ASEAN Joint Statement on Cooperation in Support of the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework. We may build on the cooperation outcomes achieved to intensify our cooperation on post-pandemic recovery.Second, we need to bolster the drivers for development. China-ASEAN cooperation enjoys high complementarity and strong vitality. We need to further tap the potentials of cooperation, improve regional cooperation platforms and upgrade cooperation mechanisms to cultivate development strengths. Our cooperation may center around five lines of efforts, namely trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, new-type industrialization, digitization, low-carbon development and agricultural modernization. This way, we could raise our collective competitiveness and take our cooperation to new heights. — We need to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We have jointly announced the official launch of negotiations on a new round of upgrade of our Free Trade Area. We need to use this opportunity to raise the quality and level of trade and investment cooperation, better link up our industrial, supply and value chains, and enable more ASEAN companies to share in China’s opportunities. ASEAN countries are most welcome to play a part in building the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, to make regional connectivity more efficient and resilient. China proposes that we further develop the Smart Customs, Smart Borders and Smart Connectivity to make trade more secure and convenient. China welcomes the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on Strengthening Sanitary and Phytosanitary Cooperation between China and ASEAN. We need to enhance coordination, keep as many ports of entry open as possible and raise the efficiency of customs clearance.— We need to advance new-type industrialization. The fourth industrial revolution has brought valuable opportunities to all countries, opportunities that must be leveraged to upgrade our industries. China is ready to work with ASEAN to accelerate the development of demonstration zones for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation on industrial capacity, and enhance the performance of joint demonstration zones for innovative development. The Chinese side has officially set up the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund II to support major infrastructure and energy projects in ASEAN. Next year, China will host a China-ASEAN Cooperation Forum on Emerging Industries to boost cooperation in information and communications, energy conservation, environmental protection, new energy and other fields. China will follow through on the Special Action on Technology Transfer for Sustainable Development, and explore the possibility of establishing regional technology transfer cooperation platforms in ASEAN countries.— We need to speed up digital transformation. In developing the China-ASEAN Digital Economy Partnership, China wishes to work with ASEAN to intensify e-commerce cooperation, promote new forms and models of business such as cross-border e-commerce and smart logistics, and deepen cooperation on digital connectivity and digital transformation. China will launch the China-ASEAN Digital Talents Training Project to train 1,000 professionals for ASEAN countries in the next three years, and support leading Chinese provinces in the digital economy, such as Zhejiang, to harness their strengths and enhance exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN.— We need to pursue low-carbon economic and social development. China is prepared to provide funding support under the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund to launch with ASEAN demonstration programs for implementing the Global Development Initiative. China suggests that we cooperate under the framework of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development to enhance China-ASEAN partnership on blue economy. China welcomes the preliminary consensus reached on establishing a China-ASEAN clean energy cooperation center and looks forward to its early completion. China will host the China-ASEAN Energy Transition Roundtable and carry out training programs on clean energy capacity building. China has circulated the Fact Sheet on the China-ASEAN Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation, and looks forward to stronger cooperation to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.— We need to accelerate agricultural modernization. Ensuring food security is our top priority. We need to work together to implement the China-ASEAN Joint Statement on Food Security Cooperation, to better protect food security in the region and see that we can well meet the food needs of our two billion people. We have agreed to designate the year 2023 as the China-ASEAN Year of Agricultural Development and Food Security Cooperation, and efforts should be focused on deepening cooperation on green agriculture, poverty reduction and rural revitalization, and digital and smart agriculture. Third, we need to consolidate the underlying support for development. People’s health provides an important basis for development. China will effectively implement the cooperation programs in support of ASEAN’s response to COVID-19. We look forward to an early renewal of the China-ASEAN MOU on health cooperation, and will accelerate the establishment of the China-ASEAN Public Health Research and Development Collaborating Center to build a stronger shield for regional public health security. Human resources are the most important asset for development. China will implement the China-ASEAN Human Resource Quality Improvement Program to support human resources development in ASEAN. China has released the List of Activities in Support of the Year of ASEAN Youth, and stands ready to enhance youth exchanges as we deliver the programs of the Big Banyan Tree — China-ASEAN Youth Language Connectivity Program and the “Bridge of the Future” China-ASEAN Young Leaders Training Campus. People-to-people and cultural exchanges provide an inexhaustible driving force for common development. While ensuring COVID-related safety, China is ready to provide the greatest possible facilitation to ASEAN students to return to China for their studies, and all those who wish to return are welcome to do so. China supports the Statement on the Post-COVID-19 Recovery Plan for ASEAN Tourism, and is ready to expedite discussions toward the establishment of a China-ASEAN Tourism Ministers’ Meeting mechanism. In the next five years, China will each year provide ASEAN law enforcement personnel with 1,000 short-term training opportunities and 20 slots for degree courses in China. China will again contribute to the China-ASEAN Cooperation Fund to scale up support for practical cooperation programs in various fields. China is ready to expand cross-border RMB settlement with ASEAN countries and make full use of mechanisms such as the China-ASEAN Inter-Bank Association to jointly uphold regional financial stability. Fourth, we need to enhance coordination on multilateral governance of development. Global governance has ushered in the “Asian moment”. China fully supports Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand in hosting the East Asia Leaders’ Meetings, the G20 Summit, and the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, and looks forward to positive outcomes. China supports ASEAN’s community-building, ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation, and the expanding and strengthening of the ASEAN-led regional architecture that is open and inclusive. China will work with ASEAN to champion open regionalism and jointly uphold the common interests of developing countries. Colleagues, This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). As the first political document signed by China and ASEAN countries on the South China Sea, the DOC encapsulates our good-neighborliness and win-win cooperation. Over the past two decades, by committing to the full and effective implementation of the DOC, we have gradually identified an effective pathway for enhancing trust and managing differences, gained good experience of dialogue, cooperation, and joint governance, and maintained overall peace and stability in the South China Sea. China welcomes the release of the Joint Statement on the 20th Anniversary of the DOC at this meeting and highly commends the positive progress made in the COC consultations. This demonstrates our common will and resolve to uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have full confidence, wisdom and capacity to take the key to the South China Sea issue firmly in our own hands. Relevant parties need to further improve the mechanisms for maritime dialogue, and advance practical cooperation in scientific research, environmental protection, search and rescue, fisheries and countering cross-border crimes. The parties need to jointly uphold the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, better protect and harness the marine resources and explore the possibility of joint development to benefit the people of all countries. China stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to properly handle the South China Sea issue in keeping with the international law, including the UNCLOS and on the basis of mutual respect. Together, we could serve as the defender of peace, builder of friendship and champion of cooperation in the South China Sea. Colleagues,This is my last time to attend the China-ASEAN Summit. I wish to thank you, my ASEAN colleagues, for all the support and cooperation I have received over the decade. On this platform, China has proposed more than 160 important cooperation initiatives in the last ten years, and more than 99.5 percent of them have been implemented thanks to our combined efforts. It has been my great pleasure to have taken part in and witnessed the important process in the growth of China-ASEAN relations. I shall cherish all the valuable, fond memories. China-ASEAN relationship benefits both sides. We are good neighbors who will always be there for each other. We are good friends that can be counted on, and good partners that no one can set apart. We have every confidence in the future of this relationship. I am sure our friendship and cooperation will enjoy broader prospects, and the region that we all call home will see an even brighter future. Thank you.
                

                Li KeqiangPremier of the State Council ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the invitation of Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen, I will soon pay an official visit to Cambodia, a beautiful country with an ancient civilization, and attend the leaders’ meetings on East Asian cooperation. This will be my first visit abroad in nearly three years since the outbreak of COVID-19, and my first face-to-face meeting with other East Asian leaders in two years.Recent years have witnessed continued growth of relations between our two countries. In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a successful visit to Cambodia. In 2020, President Xi awarded Cambodian Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk the Friendship Medal of the People’s Republic of China. Both events marked new chapters in China-Cambodia friendship.As I write this, my memories from two years ago come flooding back. I recall the generous support King (Nododom) Sihamoni and Queen Mother Monineath kindly offered to China during our toughest days of the battle against COVID; I recall Prime Minister Hun Sen’s call on us amid heavy snow and the epidemic onslaught; and I recall how 86 Cambodian children, who had received medical treatment in China for congenital heart disease, and their families made every effort possible to pool together some 5,000 masks and donated them to China. These stories well illustrate our strong friendship and solidarity to overcome difficulties together. They still warm the hearts of hundreds of millions of people in China.It is with warmth in heart that I am embarking on my visit. Such warmth also comes from my unforgettable experience of working together with Cambodian and other leaders in the region to promote regional cooperation and make the life of our people better.Our sincere cooperation has produced tangible results. Such achievements are recorded in the history of our joint pursuit of common development, and will be forever etched in our memory.Such achievements are taking forward the historic process of China and ASEAN countries working together for a shared future.Given the profound and complex changes in our region and the world and a significant rise in factors of instability, uncertainty and insecurity, it is imperative that we the countries in the region build on our historical experience and seize the current opportunities, and open up new prospects for the future if we are to maintain stability and keep the momentum of development going.Despite the fluid international landscape over the past years, East Asian cooperation has maintained an upward trend in general.This is the tenth consecutive time that I attend the leaders’ meetings on East Asian cooperation.Over the past ten years, China and other countries in the region have made the best of our geopolitical proximity, economic complementarity, cultural affinity and our potentials to promote results-oriented cooperation.A number of major projects such as the China-Laos railway and Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway have been delivered, providing strong underpinning for the economic growth and livelihood improvement in the region.We have continued to push for trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. China-ASEAN trade has withstood external headwinds, and our trade volume has grown from US$400 billion to US$800 billion.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has entered into force. This multilateral free trade agreement is the world’s largest in terms of both economic aggregate and population served. It has injected strong impetus to regional economic integration, economic globalization and free trade.Despite difficulties and challenges, we the countries in the region have properly addressed issues at sea and managed our differences. We have pressed ahead with consultations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea, carried out results-oriented maritime cooperation, and worked to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.Faced with the persistent COVID pandemic, we the countries in the region have come together in solidarity and supported each other, adding new dimensions to our friendship.The millennium-old friendship between China and Cambodia has withstood the test of time. This great friendship has transcended time and has remained as strong as ever. This is attributed to the efforts and commitment of generations of leaders from both sides.We have firmly supported and spoken up for each other on issues of core interests and major concerns. The proven mutual trust and friendship have been deeply embedded in the hearts of our peoples. The deeper the roots of friendship, the lusher the foliage and the bigger the fruits of cooperation. We are heartened to see the significant progress and achievements of our bilateral cooperation in agricultural produce, industrial parks, industrial capacity and infrastructure.In the past few years, as the China-Cambodia Free Trade Agreement was signed and entered into force, our bilateral trade has exceeded US$10 billion, two years earlier than expected.High-quality rice, Basa fish, bananas, mangoes, and the longan from Cambodia are readily available on Chinese market and on the menu of Chinese households.Over 170 companies from around the world have settled in the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which was jointly developed by our two countries, creating nearly 30,000 job opportunities for local people.Construction of the new international airport in Siem Reap is well underway. The expressway from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville, the first of its kind in Cambodia, has been completed. I am convinced that Cambodia will be well on track to achieve rapid overall development.Today’s world, albeit rife with challenges, is brimming with hope. In a great era like ours, China-Cambodia friendship and the broad vision, foresight and wisdom featured in East Asian cooperation, such as mutual respect, equality, mutual learning, cooperation, mutual benefit, openness and inclusiveness, all represent a powerful force to lead the way forward, heal the differences, and inspire the pursuit of the greater good for the region and beyond. We need to build on and carry forward this valuable spirit, and take up the responsibilities of our times that are entrusted to us by the people.Faced with the volatile international landscape and the treacherous global economic situation, we need to stay committed to multilateralism and economic globalization, which represents the way forward.We need to strengthen complementarity between our development strategies, earnestly implement the RCEP, drive our cooperation on the two wheels of regional trade and free trade, and work together to build an open regional economy.We need to seize the opportunities created by the new revolution in science, technology and industry, foster new drivers for cooperation in such areas as 5G, artificial intelligence and smart cities.We need to accelerate the transition toward a digital economy and a digital society. More importantly, we need to carry out extensive international cooperation on technology and innovation, and rise above high walls to share technological breakthroughs so that the entire humanity could reap benefits.We need to rise to the challenges of climate change and the crisis of energy security. China will work with ASEAN to make the clean energy cooperation center a success, and promote green, low-carbon and sustainable development in the region.We need to address the impacts of the pandemic on people’s livelihood. To this end, China is willing to contribute to the improvement of people’s livelihood in the region. And we will do so, among others, through demonstration projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the East Asia Cooperation Initiative on Poverty Reduction.China will do its part to help ensure a stable supply in food and energy. China will also do what it can to help international students from ASEAN countries to return to Chinese schools as early as possible. We will continue to deepen people-to-people exchanges by promoting cultural and tourism cooperation.China always firmly supports ASEAN unity and centrality. Our respective circles of friends may well engage in constructive interactions and develop in parallel. Our ASEAN friends can rest assured that there will be no pressure from China for you to take sides, only encouragement for common progress in solidarity.As readers may be aware, the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened its 20th National Congress last month. The Congress drew the strategic roadmap for building China into a modern socialist country in all respects and for advancing China’s national rejuvenation on all fronts. As the largest developing country in the world, China will remain focused on running our own affairs well to deliver a better life for the Chinese people.The Chinese economy has gone through an unusual journey this year. Confronted with complex and intricate factors at home and abroad, the economy once came under downward pressure beyond expectation. We responded swiftly and resolutely, and introduced a policy package for stabilizing the economy and follow-up measures.Our macro policies were both robust and effective, well-calibrated and appropriate, without compromising the prospects of future growth. We focused our efforts on helping market entities stay afloat and keeping employment and prices stable. This enabled us to keep the major economic indicators within an appropriate range.Going forward, we will take strong measures to ensure steady, sound and sustainable growth of China’s economy. Openness brings progress, promotes growth, and inspires innovation. China will stay committed to its fundamental state policy of opening up, and will open still wider to the world. We will intensify reforms to streamline government administration, delegate power, improve regulation, and upgrade services.China will continue to foster an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law, and up to international standards. China will reach new heights in opening up, remain a popular destination for investment, and share development opportunities with the world.As a Cambodian proverb goes, “Where there is road, there is hope.” The road ahead may not be smooth. That said, “No mountain is higher than a climber, and no road is longer than a marcher”, as a Chinese contemporary poet wrote. China will stand together through times of adversity with Cambodia and other countries in the region, and work together to build a stronger China-Cambodia friendship and a closer East Asian cooperation.
                

                Address by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands5 November 2022Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,On behalf of the government and people of China and also in my own name, I wish to extend hearty congratulations on the opening of this meeting.Since ancient times, human beings have always preferred to live close to water bodies, and civilizations have taken shape near water bodies. There has been a close link between wetlands and how humans live and work. This meeting, themed “Wetlands Action for People and Nature”, will explore ways to further preserve and develop wetlands. It is a meeting of great significance. It gives us an opportunity to raise awareness, strengthen cooperation, and scale up wetlands action across the world.— It is important that we build global consensus on prizing wetlands, show our respect for nature, minimize disruption and damage caused by human activities, and protect the ecological security of wetlands, in order to leave the beautiful wetlands to our future generations.— It is important that we advance the global process on wetlands conservation, redouble efforts to preserve authenticity and integrity, include more important wetlands in nature reserves, improve cooperation mechanisms and platforms, and increase the coverage of wetlands of international importance.— It is important that we enhance people’s well-being globally by leveraging the role of wetlands in promoting sustainable development, tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity, and delivering more benefits to people around the world.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Historic achievements have been made in wetlands conservation in China. We have increased the area of wetlands to 56.35 million hectares, put in place a protection system, and enacted a Wetlands Conservation Law. Wetlands have become an integral part of many Chinese cities like Wuhan, making the cities notably more livable. China will pursue a modernization of harmony between humanity and nature, and promote high-quality development in the wetlands conservation cause.China has recently drawn up a layout plan of national parks. Under the plan, China will designate a number of national parks, accounting for about 10 percent of the country’s land area. About 11 million hectares of wetlands will be incorporated in the national park system, with a focus on developing wetland national parks including the Three-River-Source National Park, the Qinghai Lake National Park, the Ruoergai National Park, the Yellow River Estuary National Park, the Liao River Estuary National Park and the Songnen Plain Crane Homeland National Park. A national wetlands conservation plan and major conservation projects will be implemented. China will promote international exchanges and cooperation to protect the four bird migration routes passing China and to build an international mangrove center in Shenzhen. China supports the convening of a conference of the World Coastal Forum.As a Chinese saying goes, “The journey ahead may be long and arduous, but with sustained actions, we will eventually reach our destination and embrace a brighter future.” Let us join hands to write a new chapter in global wetlands conservation.Thank you.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the Fifth China International Import Expo4 November 2022Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,Your Excellencies Heads of International Organizations,Your Excellencies Heads of Delegations,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,Good evening! I would like to extend, on behalf of the Chinese government and people and also in my own name, a warm welcome and hearty greetings to all our guests attending the fifth China International Import Expo (CIIE).Five years ago, I announced the decision to hold the CIIE for the very purpose of expanding China’s opening-up and turning our enormous market into enormous opportunities for the world. Today, the CIIE has become a showcase of China’s new development paradigm, a platform for high-standard opening-up, and a public good for the whole world.Openness is a key driving force behind the progress of human civilizations and an intrinsic path toward global prosperity and development. The world today is confronted with accelerated changes unseen in a century as well as a sluggish economic recovery. We should commit ourselves to openness to meet development challenges, foster synergy for cooperation, build the momentum of innovation, and deliver benefits to all. We should steadily advance economic globalization, enhance every country’s dynamism of growth, and provide all nations with greater and fairer access to the fruits of development.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,As the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has underscored, China remains committed to the fundamental national policy of opening up to the outside world, pursues a mutually beneficial strategy of opening-up, and adheres to the right course of economic globalization. We will amplify the interplay between domestic and international markets and resources,strive to create new opportunities for the world with our own development, and contribute our share to building an open global economy.—China will work with all countries and all parties to share the opportunities in its vast market. We will step up efforts to cultivate a robust domestic market, upgrade trade in goods, develop new mechanisms for trade in services, and import more quality products. We will establish pilot zones for Silk Road e-commerce cooperation and build national demonstration zones for innovative development of trade in services, so as to encourage innovation in trade and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.—China will work with all countries and all parties to share the opportunities from its institutional opening-up. We will steadily expand institutional opening-up with regard to rules, regulations, management and standards, put into full effect the new Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment, and further develop the national integrated demonstration zone for greater openness in the service sector. We will implement the strategy to upgrade pilot free trade areas, accelerate the Hainan Free Trade Port development, and tap into their role as pilot platforms for comprehensive reform and opening-up.—China will work with all countries and all parties to share the opportunities from deepened international cooperation. We will engage fully and deeply in WTO reform negotiations, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and enhance international macro-economic policy coordination, with a view to jointly fostering new drivers for global growth. We will endeavor actively to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) to expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas. We will firmly support other developing countries and assist them in growing faster, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,“After endless mountains and rivers that leave doubt whether there is a path out, suddenly one encounters the shade of a willow, bright flowers and a lovely village.” As this ancient Chinese poem indicates, the path is unfolding before us, and a brighter future beckons beyond. China is ready to work with all countries to practice true multilateralism, build more consensus for openness, jointly overcome the difficulties and challenges confronting global economic growth, and make sure that our commitment to openness will bring about broad prospects for global development.Thank you!
                

                Remarks by H.E. Wang YiMember of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the Symposium on Global MaritimeCooperation and Ocean Governance 2022Distinguished Guests,Friends,It gives me great pleasure to join you again at the opening ceremony of the Symposium on Global Maritime Cooperation and Ocean Governance. Let me begin by extending a hearty welcome to all of the friends present today and warm congratulations on the opening of the symposium!Not long ago, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was held successfully. In his report to the Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that China has always been committed to its foreign policy goals, i.e. upholding world peace and promoting common development, and is dedicated to promoting a community with a shared future for mankind. This is China’s solemn pledge to the world. Embarking on a new journey, China will bring more opportunities to the development of all countries and make even greater contributions to the progress of humanity.Friends,President Xi Jinping once observed, “This blue planet that we share does not consist of isolated islands separated by oceans, but is one connected by oceans as a community with a shared future where people of all countries have a common stake.” China stands ready to work with all countries to act in the spirit of building a maritime community with a shared future advocated by President Xi Jinping, coordinate maritime development and security, and advance maritime cooperation and ocean governance.First, jointly safeguard maritime security.Maritime disputes should be properly handled through peaceful means. It is important to resolve disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests through dialogue and consultation, exercise restraint, avoid taking unilateral moves that might complicate the situation, and refrain from resorting to the use or threat of force.Maritime challenges should be responded with a spirit of solidarity. All must transcend zero-sum mentality, work together to address threats such as piracy, transnational crimes, smuggling and drug trafficking, and jointly safeguard freedom and security of navigation.Maritime hegemony should be rejected with an unequivocal attitude. Certain major country refuses to join the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Furthermore, it has created the Indo-Pacific Strategy, put together exclusive small circles, and doubled down on provocative close-range maneuvers and muscle-flexing. This jeopardizes peace and tranquility at sea and therefore should be rejected by all.Second, jointly promote maritime development.We need to enhance maritime connectivity and ensure unimpeded marine transportation and industrial chains. China is ready to work with all parties to pursue high-quality cooperation in building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and actively develop the Partnership for Blue Economy, so as to inject fresh impetus into world economic recovery.We need to apply the new development philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development to ensure sustainable development of the ocean. We may seize the opportunity of advancing the Global Development Initiative to speed up the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, balance the development and protection of the ocean, and make joint development a success.We need to vigorously pursue practical cooperation on areas such as marine scientific research, ecological conservation, emergency search and rescue and disaster prevention and relief, and collectively tackle global challenges such as climate change and rising sea levels, so as to look after this blue home that we share.Third, jointly discuss ocean governance.We need to uphold true multilateralism. Further efforts should be made to improve the governance system centered around the United Nations. The national conditions unique to different countries should be fully accommodated and all countries’ legitimate aspirations and concerns should be respected. Issues that matter to all should be addressed through consultation participated by all.We need to safeguard the maritime order underpinned by international law. UNCLOS should be interpreted and applied accurately, comprehensively and in its entirety. It is important to earnestly respect the legitimate rights and interests of all countries under UNCLOS and customary international law, refrain from imposing one’s own position on others, oppose attempts to abuse dispute settlement procedures, stay committed to friendly consultation with a spirit of mutual accommodation, and work together to safeguard the global maritime order and promote international maritime cooperation.We need to advance regional maritime governance in the regional context. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). As the first political document signed by China and ASEAN countries on the South China Sea, the DOC has served as a stabilizer in the South China Sea and helped foster a peaceful regional environment for the growth of China-ASEAN relations. China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to accelerate consultations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea, establish rules on interactions at sea that serve the common interests of all parties, and truly build the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.Friends,Advancing maritime cooperation and ocean governance is a systemic endeavor, and more importantly a glorious mission. It requires the wide participation and strong support of people with vision from all countries. This symposium has its focus on both the region and the world at large. I look forward to an in-depth exchange as well as your wisdom and contribution. To conclude, I wish the symposium a full success.Thank you.
                

                Beijing, 1 November 2022Dear Colleagues,I am delighted to attend with you the 21st meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). I wish to thank you for your strong support and active cooperation extended to China in hosting the meeting. Over the past 21 years since its inception, the SCO has made important contributions to peace and stability in the region and to the development and prosperity of our countries. It has grown into an important platform for regional cooperation on the Eurasian continent. At the meeting of the Council of Heads of State held in Samarkand last September, the parties reached new common understandings on the development of the SCO. President Xi Jinping called for joint efforts to build our region into a peaceful, stable, prosperous and beautiful home. The SCO has long been a priority on China's diplomatic agenda. China will continue to deepen political trust, win-win cooperation and friendly exchanges with members of the SCO family, to jointly deliver greater benefits to the people of our countries. Colleagues, The regional and global landscapes are undergoing profound and complex changes. Global growth is languid. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties are interwoven. Nonetheless, upholding peace and pursuing development remain the trend of our times and the people's aspirations. China is ready to work with all parties to champion the Shanghai Spirit and boost the development and invigoration of all our countries. With this in mind, I wish to make the following proposals:First, we need to safeguard security and stability to foster a sound environment for development. Security and stability form the basis for development and prosperity. Faced with a shifting regional security situation, China wishes to deepen law enforcement and security cooperation with all parties. Our cooperation mechanisms between the competent authorities must live up to their role in tackling unconventional security threats, including drug trafficking and cross-border organized crimes, to provide safeguards for our economic and social development. Second, we need to expand trade and investment to bolster regional economic recovery. The SCO members are all participants, builders and beneficiaries of economic globalization. We need to jointly uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime and support the development of an open world economy. We need to further tap our potential for economic cooperation and trade, harmonize our rules of trade and explore institutional arrangements, to enhance trade and investment facilitation. The business environment is the soil for companies to emerge and grow. We need to take strong and effective steps to improve policies, clear obstacles and build platforms to provide our businesses with a sound environment for cross-border investment. China proposes that we advance the implementation of the Framework for Cooperation in Trade in Services between our competent authorities, update the content of cooperation and scale up trade in services. China will work with all parties on the formulation of a plan of action for promoting e-commerce among the member states. All parties are welcome to participate in the upcoming fifth China International Import Expo and the China-SCO online shopping festival. With continuous efforts to advance mutually beneficial cooperation on e-commerce in our region, we could all share in the fruits of a growing digital economy. Third, we need to enhance connectivity to realize integrated development of the region. Broader and easier connectivity among regional countries is crucial for generating more win-win outcomes. We need to further align the Belt and Road Initiative with our national development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives, and enhance policy communication and coordination. We need to build up infrastructure hardware in transportation and communications and enhance “soft connectivity” of information and data in an integrated manner, to speed up regional economic integration. China suggests that we all pitch in to develop the Smart Customs, Smart Borders and Smart Connectivity, engage in customs clearance facilitation programs for rail transportation, promote mutual recognition of Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs), and build more “single window” platforms for international trade, to raise the efficiency of clearance at ports of entry.China suggests that we continue to expand the scale of local currency settlement and craft new models of investment and financing, to better support our major projects and industrial cooperation. China looks forward to your active support and participation in the SCO industrial and supply chains forum that China will host next year, as a joint effort to preserve the resilience and stability of regional industrial and supply chains and promote smooth economic circulations in the region.Fourth, we need to promote sustainable development to build up resilience against risks. As we speak, looming food and energy security risks are posing challenges to sustainable development in the region. We need to fully implement the two statements on food and energy security adopted at the SCO summit earlier this year, to enhance the capacity of regional countries for food and energy supply. We need to harness existing platforms, including relevant SCO ministerial meetings and the SCO Demonstration Base for Agricultural Technology Exchange and Training, to deepen cooperation in modern agriculture. Through joint implementation of the SCO program of cooperation on renewable energy, we need to pursue a balanced and orderly transition to green and low-carbon development, and see that the transition contributes to economic development and people's wellbeing while ensuring stable and secure energy supply.Fifth, we need to enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges to strengthen the bond between the people. People-to-people and cultural exchanges under the SCO framework hold great promise, as evidenced by the success of the signature programs including the Women's Forum, the Forum on People-to-people Friendship, and the Youth Campus. We need to fully leverage the cooperation mechanisms on education, culture, science, technology and press, and carry out more cooperation programs that are popular among the people, to deepen our mutual understanding and friendship.China is ready to host an SCO forum on sister cities next year, continue with programs on youth development cooperation, and carry out activities such as SCO TV festival and exhibitions of radio and television technologies. We will partner with all sides to ensure the success of activities under the SCO Year of Tourism next year, and create new highlights for people-to-people and cultural cooperation.Colleagues,The Chinese economy has gone through an unusual journey this year. Confronted with complex and intricate factors at home and abroad, the economy once came under downward pressures beyond expectation, with a notable decline early in the second quarter. We responded swiftly and resolutely, and introduced a policy package for stabilizing the economy and follow-up measures. Our macro policies were both robust and effective, well-calibrated and appropriate, without compromising the prospects of future growth. We focused our efforts on helping market entities stay afloat and keeping employment and prices stable. This helped us to keep the major economic indicators within an appropriate range. We stepped up policy support to businesses to provide them with greater relief in the tough times. The total volume of tax and fee cuts, deferrals and tax refund in the first three quarters rose by over 3.4 trillion yuan, and is expected to reach four trillion yuan for the whole year. This is mainly enabled by the funds saved in the past two years. The policy intensity has exceeded that of 2020, and burdens on market entities have been effectively lessened. To address flagging effective demand, we employed multiple tools in fiscal, financial and other policy arenas to expand effective investment and revive consumption as the main driver of the economy. Meanwhile, we continued to rely on reform to break development bottlenecks, took innovative measures to enhance the effectiveness of macro policy implementation, and worked consistently to foster a market-oriented and law-based business environment up to international standards, to better unlock market vitality and social creativity. Through these efforts, the Chinese economy reversed the downward trend in time. It registered a positive growth in the second quarter and expanded by 3.9 percent in the third quarter, showing a stabilizing and upward momentum. Employment and prices were generally stable. In the first three quarters of this year, 10 million new urban jobs were created, and the consumer price index rose by 2.8 percent year-on-year in September. Going forward, we will take strong measures to promote the steady, sound and sustainable growth of the economy. China has over 160 million market entities, and a hardworking and intelligent people. This is the greatest source of resilience and confidence for our economic development. We will continue to work for the full delivery of all the policy measures introduced for stabilizing the economy, work to maximize their effects, keep major economic indicators within the appropriate range, and strive for better results. Not long ago, the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened its 20th National Congress, during which strategic plans were laid out for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing China's rejuvenation on all fronts. We will fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy in its entirety, accelerate the creation of a new development paradigm, and focus on high-quality development, to improve the people's wellbeing and raise their quality of life. We will stay committed to the fundamental national policy of reform and opening-up and the win-win strategy of opening-up. China's door will open still wider. We will continue on the path of peaceful development, take an active part in the reform and development of the global governance system, and work with all parties to advance world peace, stability, development and prosperity.    Colleagues,As a Chinese saying goes, the flame runs high when everyone adds wood to the fire. China is ready to join hands with all parties to forge ahead with a unity of purpose, enterprise and fortitude, to jointly usher in an even brighter future.Thank you.

                Remarks by H.E. Wang QishanVice President of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Sixth Summit of the ConferenceOn Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in AsiaOctober 13, 2022Your Excellency President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev,Dear Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to attend the Sixth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). I wish to thank Kazakhstan, the Chair, for being such a thoughtful and hospitable host.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of CICA. Over the past three decades, CICA has played an active and constructive role in regional and international affairs. As the initiator of CICA, Kazakhstan  has made great contributions to CICA’s development, and China commends Kazakhstan’s efforts.Colleagues,Our world is undergoing changes unseen in a century. Destabilizing factors and uncertainty in the international environment are mounting. As an important security forum in Asia, CICA needs to strengthen solidarity and coordination, properly tackle challenges and endeavor to build an Asian community with a shared future.— We need to uphold mutual respect and mutual trust, and maintain peace and stability in Asia. We need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, manage differences and disputes through dialogue and consultation, and properly respond to traditional and non-traditional security threats and challenges. President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative, pointing the way to tackling global security challenges. China wishes to work with other countries in the region to further implement this initiative and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in Asia.— We need to uphold mutual benefit and promote the development and prosperity of all Asian countries. We need to deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and enhance all-round connectivity and regional integration, to inject strong impetus into common development. China hopes to work with all parties to actively implement the Global Development Initiative, speed up delivery of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and contribute to the sustainable development of all. — We need to uphold mutual learning and advocate harmony among Asian civilizations. Openness and inclusiveness enable progress, while self-isolation results in backwardness. We need to be broad-minded and rise above differences in ideology and social system. We need to advocate Asian values and beliefs, and carry out exchanges and dialogues among different civilizations, to help the diverse civilizations on the Asian continent flourish together.  — We need to uphold fairness and justice, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Asian countries. We need to firmly support each other in following a development path suited to our own national conditions. We need to uphold the UN-centered international system, champion true multilateralism, and oppose hegemonism and power politics, to preserve the fundamental and long-term interests of Asian countries.China has all along viewed CICA’s development from a strategic and long-term perspective, and supports the overall direction of upgrading CICA into an international organization. China will fully leverage its role as the coordinating country in related fields, host exchanges and training sessions in agriculture, green development, finance and among think tanks, and work with all parties to bring CICA cooperation to a new height. Colleagues,The Communist Party of China (CPC) will soon convene its 20th National Congress. We will stand at a new historical starting point and draw a blueprint for China’s future development. China cannot develop without the world and the world needs China for its prosperity. We hope to engage in sound interactions and pursue win-win cooperation with all parties to jointly usher in an even brighter future.Thank you.
                

                - Speech by Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong at the Opening Ceremony of the Non-governmental Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and JapanOn September 24, 2022, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the non-governmental commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan upon invitation. His speech went as follows:I am delighted to attend the opening ceremony of the non-governmental commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan on behalf of Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao. In a few days, we will mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. At this important juncture, it is both opportune and of far-reaching significance for us to jointly take stock of the course of friendly exchanges between China and Japan, review historical experience and inspirations, and look ahead to the future of bilateral relations. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Executive Committee in China for the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan, the China Public Diplomacy Association and other organizers, and express my respect and gratitude to all the friends who have supported, promoted and participated in the cause of China-Japan friendship.President Xi Jinping said that China and Japan are each other’s important neighbors separated only by a narrow strip of water, with peace and friendship being the defining feature of bilateral relations in the hearts of the two peoples.The millennium-year-long history of mutual learning and friendly exchanges between the two peoples and the strong bond of cultural ties between the two countries have provided a solid foundation and a source of strength for China-Japan relations, leaving behind many touching tales. On this occasion, I would like to share some stories of friendship between the two countries that impress me most.The first story is about Zen master Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryuki in Japanese), who traveled east to Japan and sowed the seeds of friendship between the two peoples. In the last years of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese Zen master Yinyuan Longqi was invited to Japan to promote Buddhism. The Obaku school of Zen that he founded became one of the three major Zen sects in Japan, with millions of worshipers. Moreover, he brought to Japan advanced culture and science and technology, known locally as "Obaku culture", which had an important impact on the economic and social development of Japan during the Edo Period. The spirit of "moral support and mutual learning between the East and the West" upheld by Zen master Yinyuan Longqi has been passed on from generation to generation. It is still of exemplary significance for the friendly exchanges between China and Japan.The second story is about the profound friendship between Lu Xun and his teacher Fujino Genkuro, which is an embodiment of "friendship knows no borders". In his article "Mr. Fujino", Mr. Lu Xun recalled how he made acquaintance and a friend of his Japanese teacher Fujino Genkuro. This article has been included in the Chinese textbook for middle schools in China and has influenced several generations of Chinese people. After parting with Mr. Fujino, Mr. Lu Xun missed him a lot, and said with profound affection that "Of all those I consider as my teachers, he is the one to whom I feel most grateful and who gave me the most encouragement". In October 1936, when the news of Lu Xun's death reached Japan, it is said that Mr. Fujino held the newspaper carrying Lu Xun’s photo above his head, and bowed several times to pay homage. In sorrow and grief, Mr. Fujino wrote a short and touching essay titled "Remembering Mr. Zhou Shuren"(Lu Xun is the pen name of Zhou Shuren).The third story is about the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe overcoming difficulties and unswervingly promoting cultural exchanges between China and Japan. In 1958, the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe adapted the Chinese opera "The White-Haired Girl" into a ballet and staged it in China, causing a sensation. For more than half a century, the troupe has visited China to give performances for nearly 20 times, winning wide acclaim and writing a chapter of "ballet diplomacy" in the history of friendly exchanges between China and Japan. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other Chinese Party and state leaders cordially met with members of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe many times. The founders of the troupe Shimizu Masao and Matsuyama Mikiko also won the cultural exchange contribution awards conferred by the Chinese government in 2004.The fourth story is about the mutual assistance between the two peoples in overcoming difficulties in recent years, and joint effort to foster friendship in the new era. We will never forget the touching stories of the two peoples helping each other during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 and the devastating earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the two peoples have joined hands to fight the pandemic, writing a chapter of mutual help and support, as described by the poetic lines like, "Though on different lands, we share the same sky"; "Mountains cannot keep us apart, we weather the storm together". During the Winter Olympic Games Beijing 2022, the Chinese mascot Bing Dwen Dwen was out of stock in Japan because of its rising popularity, and the Japanese figure skater Hanyu Yuzuru set off a wave of "Hanyu fever" in China. All these attest to the vitality and enthusiasm of the friendship between the people of the two countries.Fifty years ago, with great political wisdom and strategic vision, the elder generation of leaders of the two countries made the important political decision to normalize the diplomatic relations between China and Japan, opening a new chapter of bilateral relations. The cause of peace, friendship and cooperation between China and Japan has benefited the two countries and peoples, and made important contributions to Asia and the world at large. It deserves to be cherished and we should make unremitting efforts in this regard.President Xi Jinping has said that the China-Japan friendship is rooted among the people, and the future of China-Japan relations lies in the hands of the two peoples. Standing at the new starting point of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations, we hope friends from all walks of life in our two countries will renew the original aspiration of our two countries for peace and friendship, carry forward the tradition of friendship between our peoples, and conduct extensive exchanges and cooperation, including those among young people, so as to deepen and consolidate the foundation of China-Japan friendship. I am confident that with our joint efforts, China-Japan relations will make sustained progress, brim with renewed vigor and vitality, and embrace even brighter prospects for development.* * * * *President of the China Public Diplomacy Association Wu Hailong, former Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cheng Yonghua, Japanese Ambassador to China Tarumi Hideo and Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China Ikezoe Yoichi attended and addressed the opening ceremony. The guests said in their speeches that over the 50 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields have made great progress, bringing tangible benefits to the two countries and peoples. They look forward to the two sides taking the opportunity of commemorating the 50th anniversary to stick to economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, continuously enhance mutual understanding and friendly feelings between the two peoples, and push for greater development of China-Japan relations in the next 50 years.This non-governmental commemoration was themed "Working in Concert for a Shared Future". Through cultural exchange exhibitions, photo exhibitions, youth interaction, corporate promotion, interactive live streaming and other means, it showcased the achievements in people-to-people and cultural exchanges and economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan over the 50 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations.
                

                Statement by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt the General Debate of the 77th Session ofThe United Nations General AssemblyNew York, September 24, 2022Mr. President, Dear Colleagues,We are at a time fraught with challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has kept resurfacing. Global security faces uncertainty. Global economic recovery is fragile and unsteady, and various risks and crises are emerging. The world has entered a new phase of turbulence and transformation. Changes unseen in a century are accelerating. But we are also at a time full of hope. The world continues to move toward multi-polarity; economic globalization is deepening, and our societies are becoming increasingly digitized and culturally diversified. Indeed, countries are becoming ever more interconnected and interdependent. Peace and development remain the underlying trend of our times. Around the world, the people’s call for progress and cooperation is getting louder than ever before. How should we respond to the call of our times and ride on the trend of history to build a community with a shared future for mankind? China’s answer is firm and clear:First, we must uphold peace and oppose war and turbulence. Chinese President Xi Jinping notes that peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when we are benefiting from it. But none of us can live without it. Peace is crucial for our future and it underpins common security of all countries. Turbulence and war can only open Pandora’s box, and he who instigates a proxy war can easily burn his own hands. Pursuing one’s own absolute security can only undermine global strategic stability. We should remain committed to addressing differences through peaceful means and resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation. Second, we must pursue development and eliminate poverty. Development holds the key to resolving difficult issues and delivering a happy life to our people. We should place development at the center of the international agenda, build international consensus on promoting development, and uphold all countries’ legitimate right to development. We should foster new drivers for global development, forge a global development partnership, and see that everyone in every country benefits more from the fruits of development in a more equitable way. Third, we must remain open and oppose exclusion. President Xi Jinping once pointed out that openness is the sure way to realize human prosperity and advancement. Protectionism can only boomerang and decoupling and supply chain disruption will hurt both those who practice them and others. We should stay true to openness and inclusiveness and tear down fences and barriers that hinder the free flow of factors of production. We should uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and endeavor to build an open world economy. Fourth, we must stay engaged in cooperation and oppose confrontation. As we face a host of global challenges, our biggest strength will come from solidarity; our best strategy is to stick together through thick and thin; and the brightest prospect is win-win cooperation. It is only natural that countries sometimes have problems and differences among them, but they should increase mutual understanding on the basis of equality and respect. We should engage in dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation, and reject conflict, coercion and zero-sum game. We should jointly oppose group politics and bloc confrontation.Fifth, we must strengthen solidarity and oppose division. President Xi Jinping once stated that countries around the world are like passengers aboard the same ship who share a common stake. All of us passengers should pull together to navigate the ship through storm toward a bright future. Our world must embrace diverse civilizations if it is to make continuous advances, and mankind must pursue an inclusive path if it is to achieve modernization. Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of humanity. Difference in system should not be used as an excuse to create division; still less should democracy and human rights be used as tools or weapons to achieve political ends. We should stand against drawing lines on ideological grounds, and we should work together to expand common ground and convergence of interests to promote world peace and development. Sixth, we must uphold equity and oppose bullying. Mutual respect and equality of countries big and small is a primary principle of the UN Charter. Major international issues should be handled by all countries, and international rules should be drawn up by all countries together. No country is above others, and no country should abuse its power to bully other sovereign countries. We should promote and practice true multilateralism, promote equality of all countries in terms of rights, rules and opportunities, and build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, equity and justice, and win-win cooperation. Mr. President,Colleagues,China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the world’s largest developing country, is committed to boosting solidarity and cooperation with other countries. It will follow the trend of the times and pursue the shared interests of the vast majority of countries.China has been a builder of world peace. We have actively promoted the cause for international peace and participated in the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation process. China is the top contributor of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the UN Security Council; and it is the second largest funding contributor to both the UN and its peacekeeping operations. China is the only country in the world that pledges to “keep to a path of peaceful development” in its Constitution. It is the only one among the five Nuclear-Weapon States that is committed to no-first-use of nuclear weapons. China has thus made important contribution to maintaining global strategic stability.In response to various security challenges facing the world, President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative. He called on the international community to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, to abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to take the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, and to maintain security in both traditional and non-traditional domains. By putting forward this initiative, he has contributed China’s vision to reducing the peace deficit facing humanity and provided China’s input to meeting global security challenges.China has been a contributor to global development. We have endeavored to build a system of high-standard opening-up and safeguard the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. China is a major trading partner of over 130 countries and regions. Contributing about 30 percent of annual global growth, China is the biggest engine driving the global economy. China is a pacesetter in implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It has met the poverty reduction goal ten years ahead of the envisioned timeframe and accounts for 70 percent of the gains in global poverty reduction. China is also an active participant in global governance and South-South cooperation. It set up the China-UN Peace and Development Trust Fund and the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund. It has provided development aid to more than 160 countries in need, and extended more debt-service payments owed by developing countries than any other G20 member state. At the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Development Initiative. Putting the people at the center, this initiative is a rallying call to refocus attention of the international community on development and build a global community of development. At the recent High-level Dialogue on Global Development he chaired, President Xi Jinping announced several dozen concrete major steps to implement this initiative, generating strong impetus for accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On the margins of this General Assembly session, China has hosted a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, building more consensus on pursuing this initiative. As China forges ahead, its fast train of development will continue to drive global growth and deliver more benefits to the people of all countries.China has been a defender of the international order. We are committed to upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the international system with the UN at its core and the international order based on international law. China has been involved in multilateral affairs in all fields. It is a member of almost all universal inter-governmental organizations and a party to over 600 international conventions. It has concluded more than 27,000 bilateral treaties and fulfilled in good faith its international obligations. China abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has made relentless efforts to protect and strengthen its human rights. At the same time, China is firmly against attempts to politicize human rights and has worked to advance the healthy development of international human rights cooperation.As a member of the developing world, China will forever stand together with other developing countries. We are heartened to see the rapid progress achieved by the developing world in recent years, and we will continue to speak up for other developing countries, help them overcome difficulties and fully support efforts in raising the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs. Developing countries are no longer the “silent majority” in international and multilateral processes. With stronger solidarity among ourselves, we China and other developing countries have spoken out for justice, and we have become a pillar of promoting development cooperation and safeguarding equity and justice. China has been a provider of public goods. In the face of COVID-19, China has made all-out efforts to advance and engage in global cooperation against the pandemic. We have done our best to provide anti-pandemic supplies and shared our practices on combating the virus. China is among the first to promise making COVID-19 vaccines a global public good and to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines. China has provided over 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.In response to tough challenges confronting global development, President Xi Jinping proposed to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, an initiative that has been widely endorsed by the international community. China has signed cooperation documents with 149 countries and 32 international organizations. We have set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, thus building the most extensive, inclusive and largest platforms for international cooperation.In response to the shared concerns of various countries about data security, we launched the Global Initiative on Data Security as our contribution to formulating rules on global data security.In response to climate change, China is committed to pursuing a development path that puts ecological conservation first, one of green and low-carbon growth. We announced the ambitious carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and are working to implement the Paris Agreement. China accounts for one-fourth of all the trees planted globally. We have been making unremitting efforts to foster a community of life for man and Nature.In response to global food security challenges, China has put forth a cooperation initiative on global food security. This year, we have provided over 15,000 tons of emergency humanitarian food assistance to other developing countries in need.China has been a mediator of hotspot issues. As a responsible major country, China has explored workable Chinese approaches to solving hotspot issues. While adhering to the principle of non-interference in others’ domestic affairs and respecting the will and needs of the countries concerned, China has endeavored to help settle hotspot issues in a constructive way. Our approach is one of promoting peace through negotiation, one that is both fair and pragmatic and that aims to address both the symptoms and root causes of hotspot issues. China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to restore peace through negotiation. To achieve a fundamental solution, it is important to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties concerned and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. We call on all parties concerned to keep the crisis from spilling over and protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries. The Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East issue. Justice is already late in coming, but it must not be absent. The two-state solution is crucial for upholding fairness and justice. China will continue to support the Palestinian people in pursuing their just cause of restoring legitimate national rights.To resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, it is important to address its root cause. We need to follow the dual-track approach and take phased and synchronized steps. We should jointly uphold peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation. Afghanistan is in a critical transition from chaos to order. The right way forward is to put in place an inclusive political framework and adopt moderate policies. The goal should be to resume economic growth and improve people’s lives. To achieve this goal, Afghanistan should combat terrorism and integrate itself into the region. A small number of countries have arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, cut off development aid and frozen lawful assets of other countries. This is an unacceptable practice that must be corrected. China firmly supports the Cuban people in their just struggle to defend their sovereignty and oppose external interference and blockade.The abuse of guns is becoming an increasingly serious problem across the world. Here, I announce that China has decided to launch its domestic procedure to ratify the UN’s Firearms Protocol, a step that will contribute to strengthening global cooperation on gun control and closing the security deficit.Mr. President,Colleagues,Since ancient times, Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China’s territory. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity has never been severed and the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and same China has never changed. All of us Chinese have never ceased our efforts to realize China’s reunification.It is explicitly stated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation issued 70-odd years ago that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, including Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. This constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Fifty-one years ago, right in this august hall, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the UN and to expel the “representatives” of the Taiwan authorities from the place which they had unlawfully occupied. The so-called “dual representation” proposal put forth by the United States and a few other countries to keep Taiwan’s seat in the UN became a piece of waste paper. Once and for all, Resolution 2758 resolved, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the UN and international institutions. It completely blocked any attempt by anyone or any country to create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.The one-China principle has become a basic norm in international relations and a general consensus of the international community. When entering into diplomatic relations with China, 181 countries all recognized and accepted that there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China, and that the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. By firmly upholding the one-China principle, China is not only upholding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also truly safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and non-interference in others’ internal affairs, a basic norm of international relations that is of vital importance to the large number of developing countries.China will continue to endeavor to achieve peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and greatest efforts. To realize this goal, we must combat “Taiwan independence” separatist activities with the firmest resolve and take the most forceful steps to repulse interference by external groups. Only by resolutely forestalling in accordance with the law separatist activities can we forge a true foundation for peaceful reunification. Only when China is completely reunified can there be enduring peace across the Taiwan Strait. Any scheme to interfere in China’s internal affairs is bound to meet the strong opposition of all us Chinese, and any move to obstruct China’s cause of reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history.Mr. President, Colleagues,The international community closely follows China’s development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened ten years ago, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. In the past decade, China has made historic achievements and transformation in pursuing economic and social development. In this decade, it has also realized a historic leap in its relations with the world and made historic contributions to the international community.China is fully implementing a new development philosophy featuring innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, and it is pursuing high-quality development and fostering a new development paradigm. With the strong leadership of the CPC, concerted efforts of the 1.4 billion people, the notable strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a solid foundation underpinning sustained rapid development, and strong confidence in achieving development through its own efforts, China will enjoy sustained and sound development, usher in even brighter prospects, and make more splendid miracles come true.Mr. President, Colleagues,As China has one-fifth of the global population, its march toward modernization has important, far-reaching significance for the world. The path that China pursues is one of peace and development, not one of plunder and colonialism; it is a path of win-win cooperation, not one of zero-sum game; and it is one of harmony between man and Nature, not one of destructive exploitation of resources. We will continue to contribute our input to meeting the challenges facing human development, and make our contribution to creating a new form of human advancement.Next month, the CPC will convene its 20th National Congress in Beijing. This Congress will, in response to the expectation of all the Chinese people, set well-conceived goals and tasks for China’s development in the next five years and beyond, and it will draw an overarching plan for China’s future development. Having reached a new historical starting point, China will follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China will work with other countries to make every effort for peace and development, shoulder the responsibility for solidarity and progress, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and embrace an even better world.Thank you all!
                

                Speech by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yiat Asia SocietyNew York, September 22, 2022President Kevin Rudd of the Asia Society,Ladies and Gentlemen,It is good to be back in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, and meet friends again after an interval of three years.In the last few years, a lot has happened in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc; the global economy is in danger of a recession; and the Ukraine crisis has persisted and escalated. Issues involving food, energy, industrial and supply chains and climate change have become more acute.The past few years have seen China-U.S. relations at a low ebb since the establishment of diplomatic ties. The reality of China-U.S. interdependence is ignored; the history of our win-win cooperation is misrepresented; channels of dialogue and communication are blocked. And the bilateral relationship is being defined and impacted dangerously by so-called strategic competition. This is bringing tremendous uncertainty to the future of our peoples and to countries across the world.It is widely held that China-U.S. relations have well exceeded the bilateral scope and carry implications for the whole world. The global community expects China and the U.S. to take the lead, fulfill the responsibility as major countries, keep the bilateral ties stable and advance global cooperation.Since last year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden have had several rounds of strategic communication in flexible ways. President Xi pointed out that whether China and the U.S. can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world. It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. President Biden said that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and how this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century.Both Presidents agree that they should make the China-U.S. relationship work and not mess it up. They both believe the two countries should steer clear of conflict and confrontation. And they both stand for closer bilateral exchanges and cooperation. President Biden stressed many times that the U.S. does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; the U.S. does not support “Taiwan independence”; and it is not looking for conflict with China. People around the world hope that these important statements are translated into real actions.If two fine orchestras are to work together harmoniously, their conductors must first set the same tone, and all the players must follow the same music score. However, what has happened is that the U.S. team seems to have two different sets of music score. Their leader’s political will of a stable bilateral relationship has yet to be translated into logical policies. The Chinese people and people from other countries find this confusing, and would naturally raise questions:How will the U.S. deliver on its promise of not aiming to change China’s system, when it has framed a false narrative of “democracy versus authoritarianism”, a narrative that deliberately amplifies an ideological confrontation with China and takes aim at China’s political system, development path and governing party?How can a new Cold War be prevented, when the U.S. has, identifying China as the primary rival and the most serious long-term challenge, engaged in all-round containment, sought to encircle China by shaping the strategic environment around it, pressed other countries to pick sides and formed various small circles that exclude China?How will the U.S. honor its important statement of not supporting “Taiwan independence” when it has, regardless of China’s strong opposition, allowed its House Speaker to visit Taiwan again after 25 years, kept elevating substantive relations with Taiwan by repeated official exchanges and arms sales including many offensive weapons, and is advancing the deliberation of the “Taiwan Policy Act” that threatens the very foundation of China-U.S. relations underpinned by the three Joint Communiqués?And how to keep the industrial and supply chains between China and the U.S. and of the world stable, when the U.S. prolongs the trade war with China, keeping in place the extra tariffs on US$360 billion of Chinese goods though ruled inconsistent with the WTO rules, and extending the list of Chinese companies under its sanctions to over 1,000 entities and individuals?The United States has, on the one hand, made repeated provocations on issues involving China’s core interests and development rights and interests, yet on the other, expressed a desire to keep the bilateral ties stable and prevent conflict and confrontation. This is self-contradictory in both logic and reality.What is the crux of the matter? It boils down to how the United States perceives China, the world and itself. Be it full confrontation or strategic competition, both have deviated from the right course of China-U.S. relations.Such deviations are dangerous and come at a high price. Mr. Kevin Rudd described the current China-U.S. relations as in a workshop with exposed wires and cables lying everywhere, water on the floor and sparks flying. Mr. Joseph Nye compared the relations to a sleepwalking syndrome that could stumble into a new Cold War. Should the United States handle its relations with China with a zero-sum mindset and continue to let “political correctness” misguide its China policy, it won’t find solutions to its own problems, but lead China-U.S. relations to conflict and confrontation. The message we must send, loud and clear, is that now is the time to make serious reflections and get back onto the right track!Ladies and Gentlemen,This year marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the 40th anniversary of the August 17 Communiqué. History matters. It made things the way they are today, and helps shape a better future when its value is appreciated.A few days earlier I paid a visit to Dr. Kissinger. We reviewed how, with twists and turns, China and the U.S. came to common understanding 50 years ago and the wisdom reflected in that episode of history. Since day one of their engagement, China and the United States have been aware that each is dealing with a country very different from oneself. Yet, these differences were no obstacles to us breaking the ice and establishing diplomatic ties, no obstacles to us deepening cooperation based on common interests, still less to us making joint contributions to world peace and prosperity.Looking ahead to the next fifty years, the sound and stable growth of China-U.S. relations still depends on whether we could put these differences in perspective and, on this basis, get on to pursue our respective and common interests.Regarding the right way for China and the U.S. to get on with each other, President Xi Jinping has given a clear answer. That is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. These three principles are an important conclusion informed by the evolution of China-U.S. relations over the past 50-odd years. They are also the right way for major countries to live with each other in this era.Let me first talk about mutual respect.Without respect, no trust can be built. Without trust, conflict would be a real danger and actual cooperation could not happen. This is an important lesson drawn from past exchanges between our two countries, and also a basic prerequisite for the bilateral ties to return to the right track.In the Shanghai Communiqué issued 50 years ago, the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. Fifty years on, this guiding principle is all the more relevant. We now can see clearly that China will not become another United States, and the U.S. cannot mould China to its liking. Neither side is able to take the other down. This means we need to respect each other’s choices.Defining one’s own choice as democratic and the other’s as authoritarian, and seeing success as changing the other side in one’s own image are neither consistent with the facts, nor realistic.China respects the development path chosen by the American people. We welcome an open and confident United States that enjoys growth and progress. The U.S. should also respect Chinese people’s choice of development path, i.e. socialism with Chinese characteristics.This path is tried and tested by the Chinese people with a clear logic of history. In modern times, the Chinese people explored relentlessly for a path to save and revitalize the nation. Various models including Western systems were put into practice, but none of them worked when they failed to fit China’s realities. By adapting Marxism to the Chinese conditions and to the traditional Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully rallied the Chinese people and led them in a united endeavor to gain national independence and liberation. Eventually, China found a right path toward prosperity and strength.This path has opened up bright prospects for China’s modernization. We have built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, eradicated absolute poverty for the first time in the country’s history, and in a span of a few decades, transformed China from a poor and weak nation into the world’s second largest economy. China has fed nearly 20 percent of the world’s population with nine percent of its arable land. It now has a middle-income group that exceeds 400 million. The 1.4 billion Chinese people moving toward modernization and common prosperity will make a miracle come true in the history of development.  This path has brought true human rights and democracy to the Chinese people. The world’s largest social security network and compulsory education system have been set up. People’s all-round development is put front and center, and everyone stands a chance to reach one’s full potential. By integrating electoral democracy with consultative democracy, and procedural democracy with substantive democracy, we have advanced a whole-process people’s democracy that has won the people’s full support. Leading U.S. opinion polls show that the Chinese people’s approval rate of their government has stayed above 90 percent for several years running.  That said, we are clear-eyed that much remains to be done in China’s development. China’s per capita GDP has just exceeded US$12,000, and trails 60-plus countries. It ranks below the 70th place on the Human Development Index. These require that we stay focused on our primary task—making development more balanced and adequate and meeting the people’s higher expectation for a better life. While relying on our own efforts in developing the country and the nation, we are also ready to pursue cooperation of mutual benefit with the U.S. and other countries, to foster a favorable external environment for China’s development.The Chinese people, with a time-honored civilization of 5,000 years, are confident and self-reliant, and humble and inclusive. China will unswervingly follow its chosen path and direction, and will forge ahead steadily along this path toward greater success. China will continue to draw upon the valuable experience of other countries and achievements of all civilizations, embrace the world with open arms and open its door even wider.Some worry that China will export its ideology and threaten the values of other countries. This is completely unnecessary. China has no history of preaching to or lecturing others, and has no intention to export its system or path today. As early as 2,500 years ago, by observing the inclusiveness reflected in the laws of the universe and nature, Chinese philosophers came to the conclusion that “Just as all living things grow in harmony without hurting one another, different ways may run forward without interfering with one another.” Living in our times, we should approach differences with a greater largeness of heart than our ancestors, accept differences with an attitude of mutual respect, and actively pursue the state of harmony without uniformity.     Now let me move on to peaceful coexistence.Partner or rival? Cooperation or confrontation? These are questions of fundamental importance in China-U.S. relations, and no catastrophic mistakes could be made. To hold the bottom line of peace, we must make the right choice.I wish to tell you clearly that China chooses peace and commits to peaceful development. Our most basic expectation for China-U.S. relations is for the two countries to live with each other in peace.As China develops, some people start to project China as a hypothetical enemy, and the so-called “threat inflation” ensues. This is typical excessive anxiety and is completely unnecessary.Expansion, coercion and hegemony are never in the veins of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the Chinese believe in the ancient wisdom that “a warlike state will eventually perish”, and “a hegemonic state is doomed to fail.”   Six hundred years ago, navigator Zheng He of China’s Ming Dynasty led the most powerful fleets of his times on seven expeditions across continents, earlier than Columbus’ discovery of the new continent. Yet instead of engaging in colonization, killing or robbing, the Chinese brought tea, silk and porcelain.I once visited a history museum in Istanbul, a meeting place of Western and Eastern cultures. An exhibition hall on the left displayed relics from Turkey’s exchanges with China, mostly silk and porcelain, whereas a room on the right showcased antiques from its exchanges with the West, mainly swords, guns and armor. These exhibitions speak to vastly different stories in history. Equating the ability to develop with an intention for expansion, or predicting China based on the beaten path of traditional powers will both result in serious misjudgment.  Today’s China is built on the heritage of ancient China. For 70-plus years since the founding of the People’s Republic, China has never provoked a conflict, occupied one inch of foreign soil, started a proxy war, or joined any military bloc. China has the best peace record among the world’s major countries. The CPC, China’s governing party, has incorporated peaceful development into its constitution, and China is the only major country that has codified peaceful development in the Constitution. China is committed to not seeking hegemony, expansion, coercion or sphere of influence, and it wants to live in peace with all other countries. This is undoubtedly a big contribution to global strategic stability.For China and the U.S. to coexist in peace, we must follow the rules that both sides subscribe to. Bilaterally, they should be the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués and the important common understandings reached between leaders of the two countries, rather than imposing one’s domestic law on the other. At the international level, they should be the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter — the rules and order established with the tremendous cost borne by the world anti-fascist alliance and the enormous sacrifice made by the over 35 million Chinese casualties. As a founding member of the U.N. and the first country to sign the U.N. Charter, China has no reason, still less the need, to reinvent the wheel. China and the United States have a responsibility to jointly uphold the order and rules. If the United States’ repeated reference to a “rules-based international order” means the above-mentioned rules, China has no objection. But if it means something else on which no broad-based international consensus exists, then the U.S. has no right to impose it on others.The biggest obstacle to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States is the Cold War mentality. Just as colonialism faded out in the 20th century, the Cold War mentality has long become an anachronism in the 21st century. Some in the U.S. try to take China down by repeating the containment tactic used on the former Soviet Union, and hope to encircle China through geopolitical maneuvering like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Such attempts will only prove futile, because China is not the former Soviet Union, and the world is not what it used to be. Only after waking up from the Cold-War dream can one view and handle China-U.S. relations in a cool-headed, rational and realistic way.Third, on win-win cooperation.No cooperation can be based on a win-lose format. Win-win cooperation is not only possible, but also a must. This is the true narrative of China-U.S. relations in the past half a century, and it should remain the goal we both pursue.No two major countries have closer people-to-people contacts or more interconnected interests than China and the U.S. do. Before COVID-19 struck, there were more than 300 flights between our two countries every week and over five million mutual visits every year. We once had more than 100 dialogue and exchange mechanisms, 50 pairs of sister provinces/states, and 234 sister city relationships. Despite the pandemic and additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports, two-way trade last year topped US$750 billion, up by 28.7 percent year on year, and two-way investment reached US$240 billion. Sixty-six percent of American businesses in China reported plans to invest more in China. During this trip, I met with the representatives of the U.S. business community. They shared the view that China-U.S. cooperation has benefited people in both countries and the world and hoped to achieve greater growth in the Chinese market. These solid facts and figures fully demonstrate that the Chinese and American people want cooperation and our cooperation is driven by win-win outcomes.For some time now, a few Americans have been saying that win-win cooperation is only a political slogan. We cannot agree with this. As the world’s largest developing and developed countries, China and the United States have a lot to offer each other. We enjoy broad room for cooperation in a wide range of areas covering economy and trade, energy, science and technology, education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We shoulder important responsibilities in addressing global issues like COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, terrorism, proliferation and regional hotspots. We have also worked together and accomplished big things for the good of the world, including combating terrorism, tackling financial crises, fighting Ebola, and pushing for the Paris Agreement on climate change. An unfailing truth in China-U.S. interactions is that we both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is our best choice.Undeniably, China and the U.S. have competition in areas like economy and trade, and China does not fear such competition. However, we do not agree that China-U.S. relations should be simply defined by competition, because this is not the entirety or the mainstream of this relationship. At the same time, competition should have boundaries and, more importantly, be fair play. It should be conducted in compliance with widely recognized rules, and not be fixated on undercutting the development capability of others and denying them the legitimate rights and interests. We need healthy competition that brings out the best in each other, not vicious competition that aims at each other’s demise.One case in point here is what happened to the Chinese company Huawei. Huawei is a 100 percent private enterprise, yet the U.S. has deployed government resources to suppress it around the world, and even warned countries not to use Huawei equipment or face consequences. This is clearly not fair competition. Ideology driven, the U.S. has overstretched the concept of national security, built “small yard, high fence”, clamored for decoupling and cutting supply chains, pushed for “friend-shoring”, conceived the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and formed the Chip 4 Alliance. This is clearly not healthy competition. Such moves are not helpful to the U.S.’ own development. They will also disrupt global economic cooperation.China has developed itself in the course of reform, opening up and integration into the world. China will not and cannot decouple from the rest of the world. In pursuing high quality development and fostering a new development paradigm, China needs closer connections with the world. By shortening its negative list on foreign investment and creating a more enabling business environment, China is providing its global partners with vast cooperation opportunities. And China welcomes greater success of American businesses in the Chinese market.Based on equality and respect, China is willing to have more and better cooperation with the United States. Secretary of State Antony Blinken proposed, in his China policy speech, six areas for U.S.-China cooperation. In my meeting with Secretary Blinken in Bali, I also produced a list for our cooperation in eight areas. Together, we can make the list of cooperation longer and the pie of cooperation bigger. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and other public goods proposed by China are open to all parties, including the United States, and China also stands ready for discussions on U.S. initiatives, to bring about win-win outcomes for our two countries and the world at large.For cooperation to be win-win, there needs to be necessary conditions and atmosphere. It won’t do if the U.S. undermines China’s core interests and the foundation for bilateral cooperation on the one hand, and on the other, expects China to cooperate unconditionally. Such logic simply doesn’t work. Meanwhile, I wish to emphasize that no matter how China-U.S. relations may evolve, China, as a responsible major country, will remain actively engaged in addressing the many global challenges, fulfill its responsibilities, and make its contribution. We hope the U.S. will do the same.Ladies and Gentlemen,The Taiwan question is at the heart of China’s core interests; the one-China principle is the cornerstone of the political foundation for China-U.S. relations; the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués are the most crucial “guardrails” for our relations. As things stand, the Taiwan question is growing into the biggest risk in China-U.S. relations. Should it be mishandled, it is most likely to devastate our bilateral ties.Before any discussion of the Taiwan question, the premise should be made clear: Taiwan is a part of China’s territory; it has never been a country. Effective administrative jurisdiction of Taiwan by the Chinese government dates back hundreds of years. In 1895, Japan launched an invasion against China and forced the then Qing government to cede control of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands (also known as Pescadores Islands). It was an episode of humiliation in the history of the Chinese nation; yet the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait never ceased their struggle against aggression and separation.In 1943, the governments of China, the United States and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration, which stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. The 1945 Potsdam Declaration signed by the three countries reiterated that “the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out”. When Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender in September later that year, it pledged to “carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good faith”. The aforementioned legally-binding international instruments have fully restored Taiwan to China, both de jure and de facto.It is evident that one-China has become part of the post-war international order, and the one-China principle, a universally recognized basic norm of international relations. The U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 not only resolved once and for all the representation of the whole of China, Taiwan included, within the United Nations, but also eliminated any room for creating “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” in the international community. Over the past five decades, the U.N. has always referred to Taiwan as “Taiwan, Province of China”: this is Taiwan’s only status in international law. Recognizing and adhering to one-China is also the political prerequisite for all the 181 countries in establishing diplomatic ties with China.The U.S. also made unequivocal commitment of recognizing Taiwan as part of China. It is stated in black and white in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, the 1978 Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and the August 17 Communiqué of 1982, that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China. Successive U.S. administrations have clearly reaffirmed their commitment to the one-China policy and several U.S. Presidents have stated their opposition to Taiwan “independence”. All these have been kept on record.However, not long after China and the U.S. established diplomatic ties, the U.S. side went back on its word and passed the Taiwan Relations Act, followed by the so-called internal “Six Assurances”, constantly fudging and hollowing out the one-China principle. Both were unilateral moves by the U.S. side. They run counter to the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués. Hence, they are null and void from the very beginning, and the Chinese government has all along made clear its opposition.Just as the U.S. will not allow Hawaii to be split away, China has the right to uphold the unification of the country as Taiwan is part of China. Since the Government of the People’s Republic of China is recognized as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, Taiwan should not be allowed to join any international organization with sovereign implications. If one recognizes the one-China principle, one should not engage in any official interactions with Taiwan. The logic here cannot be simpler.Recently the U.S. has repeatedly referred to the “status quo in the Taiwan Strait”, and even accused China of “changing the status quo”. This is the very opposite of truth. To be frank, it is with U.S. interference and connivance that “Taiwan independence” forces have grown and expanded. They have kept making changes to the fundamental status quo that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, and hence pose the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have jettisoned the 1992 Consensus which embodies the one-China principle, undermined the hard-earned prospect of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and been bent on pursuing “incremental independence”. They have publicly called for Taiwan independence in the party platform, dished out a new “two states theory”, pressed for “de-sinicization” on the island, and stoked antagonism and obstructed exchanges across the Strait. “Taiwan independence”, like a highly destructive “gray rhino” charging toward us, must be resolutely stopped.Of all the major countries in the world, China is the only one that is yet to realize complete reunification. National reunification is the shared wish and aspiration of all the Chinese sons and daughters. It is also clearly stipulated in China’s Constitution. “Peaceful reunification and One country, Two systems” — this fundamental guideline best meets the overall interests of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots, and represents the most practicable and inclusive solution to addressing the difference in system between the mainland and Taiwan. Such a solution is peaceful, democratic, of goodwill and benefits both sides.Although the two sides of the Taiwan Strait practise different systems, it is not an obstacle to reunification, still less an excuse for secession. We have always worked with the greatest sincerity and effort to pursue peaceful reunification. But, we will never tolerate any activity aimed at secession. We reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This position is designed to forestall actions that violate the Anti-Secession Law; it in no way targets the fellow Chinese in Taiwan. Checking separatist activities for “Taiwan independence”, upholding territorial integrity and safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait is a sacred right that China exercises in accordance with domestic and international law.The Taiwan question arose as a result of weakness and chaos in the nation, and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality. Reunification is the trend of history and the aspiration of the people. The U.S. should choose to stand on the right side of history.Ladies and Gentlemen,In less than a month, the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress to draw a well-conceived blueprint for China’s development in the next five years and beyond. Since its founding, the CPC has taken happiness of the people and rejuvenation of the nation as its mission, and has also worked to advance progress of humanity and greater good for the world. Keeping to this founding aspiration, we will stand by the common values of humanity of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and work with people in all countries to jointly advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.Ladies and Gentlemen,President Xi Jinping noted that, “The most important event in international relations over the past 50 years was the reopening and development of China-U.S. relations, which has benefited the two countries and the whole world. The most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the U.S. to find the right way to get along.” It is our hope that China and the U.S. will draw on past experience to find inspiration for the present, and gain strength for going forward. Together, let us explore a way to a China-U.S. relationship for the new era and create a better future for both of our countries!Thank you.
                

                Keynote Address by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang YiAt the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends ofThe Global Development Initiative Dear colleagues,Welcome to the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI).At the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015, world leaders unanimously adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, setting goals for the global development cause and ushering in a new era of international development cooperation. We are nearly halfway through the timetable for implementing the 2030 Agenda, and will have a mid-term review of the Agenda next year. Global development has made positive gains over the past seven years, but is also faced with unprecedented challenges.Bearing in mind the well-being of the entire humanity, President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI at the UN General Assembly last year. Aiming at building a global community of development, the GDI puts development first and the people at the center, and seeks to expedite the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. One year on, the GDI has received the support of over 100 countries and many international organizations including the United Nations. More than 60 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI. Today, the Group of Friends has become an important force boosting solidarity and coordination among countries as they work together to pursue development. It has also become an effective platform for us to have discussions with the UN development system on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It is thus of great significance that we have this ministerial meeting today to further our discussions on development cooperation.Global development has now come to a critical juncture. Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, regional conflicts and major-country rivalry, food, energy and debt crises are emerging simultaneously. The world economy is struggling to recover, and developing countries face daunting challenges in attaining the 2030 SDGs. At the SDG Moment event yesterday, Secretary-General Guterres said that the perils facing the world are pushing the SDGs further out of reach, and that we have a long “to do” list.  The more difficulties we face, the more important it is that we join hands on the way forward. Last June, President Xi Jinping chaired the High-level Dialogue on Global Development. He and participating world leaders worked together to restore development as the centerpiece on the international agenda and forge a united, equal, balanced and inclusive global development partnership, to inject strong impetus for accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda. President Xi announced major steps to implement the GDI, including creating a Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, increasing input in the China-UN Peace and Development Fund, and setting up a global development promotion center. After the High-level Dialogue, China released 32 steps that it will take to kickstart the implementation of the GDI.The Dialogue signifies that the GDI has progressed from laying the foundation to erecting the pillars, and is evolving from broad strokes to refined details. In the meantime, China and international partners have worked on the following areas to deliver the GDI.We have built cooperation platforms. China is working with relevant parties to develop cooperation networks in such areas as agriculture, education, COVID-19 response and climate actions. One hundred and fifty institutions from nearly 40 countries and regions are making joint preparations to establish a World Technical Vocational and Education Training (TVET) League. The China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center has been established. China has engaged in co-production of COVID-19 vaccines with 13 countries, including nine from the Group of Friends. More than 40,000 training opportunities have been provided to Group of Friends countries through over 1,000 capacity building programs.We have scaled up inputs into GDI’s implementation. The Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund has been put in place to support GDI cooperation projects. China has participated actively in the replenishment of the International Development Association and the Global Environment Facility, and has officially launched the Phase III of the China-FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund, contributing its share to increasing international development resources.We have jointly tackled pressing challenges. COVID-19 has wiped out years of gains in poverty reduction, condemning over 150 million people to hunger. The GDI makes poverty reduction one of its priority areas. Cooperation projects have been tilted toward poverty reduction, food, health and other livelihood areas. Institutions from 17 countries and regions became the first to join the International NGOs Network for Poverty Reduction Cooperation. In the face of a food crisis, the Group of Friends has stated their common proposition and spoken with a collective voice at the General Assembly on food security. So far this year, China has provided multiple batches of emergency food assistance to other developing countries in need, and recently pledged to provide additional emergency humanitarian assistance. Colleagues,As the GDI initiator and the world’s largest developing country, China is ready to enhance the synergy of strategies with UN development agencies, and together with Group of Friends countries, take the following seven measures to implement the 2030 Agenda:— First, releasing the first list of projects in the GDI project pool, which includes 50 practical cooperation projects in poverty reduction, food security, industrialization and other fields, as well as 1,000 new capacity building programs. China will work with all parties for the  delivery of these projects. Parties are welcome to put forth new proposals based on their own needs to constantly expand the pool.— Second, advancing the Food Production Enhancement Action. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development will respectively sign agreements with the FAO on cooperation in digital and innovative agricultural financing, animal and plant disease prevention and control, and sustainable soil and water resource management.— Third, moving forward the Global Clean Energy Cooperation Partnership and deepening practical cooperation with the International Renewable Energy Agency and other countries to advance a transition to clean energy and realize sustainable energy security.— Fourth, bolstering cooperation on Smart Customs, Smart Borders and Smart Connectivity, and working with international organizations like the World Customs Organization and other countries to develop smart customs networks and boost supply chain connectivity in the digital era.— Fifth, launching the World Digital Education Alliance to intensify international cooperation on digital education, empower education development with digitization, and make education resources more affordable and accessible.— Sixth, jointly launching the Bamboo as a Substitute for Plastics Global Action Plan with the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization to effectively treat plastic pollution and leave a clean and beautiful planet for future generations.— Seventh, announcing that the data from the satellite “SDGSAT-1” China launched last November is open to the world, to support sustainable development research and decision-making in different countries.China will donate to the UN six sustainable development data sets including on the world’s arable land and forest coverage. This will provide data support for realizing the SDGs on food security and terrestrial ecosystem protection.Colleagues,The GDI needs common efforts and synergy from the international community. In this connection, China wishes to put forth three suggestions:First, we need to forge greater synergy through coordination and enhance the steering role of the UN development system. There could be greater synergy between the GDI and other mechanisms and processes like the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance and the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. We hope that a working mechanism can be set up at the UN level as soon as possible to advance the GDI, and that related specialized agencies take the lead in synergizing with the GDI’s priority areas based on their portfolios. The Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and the China-UN Peace and Development Fund should be put to good use to mobilize and pool more resources.Second, we need to follow the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to pool collective wisdom and strength. We need to enhance institutional building of the Group of Friends and identify coordinating countries for priority areas and regions. We should better link up the GDI with individual countries’ development needs and with regional and sub-regional development strategies, and come up with new project proposals. It is important that we step up strategic communication, continue to speak with one voice, and work together for positive outcomes from next year’s mid-term review of the 2030 Agenda and the SDG Summit.Third, we need to uphold inclusiveness and common progress and renew global development partnership. Currently there is a huge shortfall in global development resources. We hope that developed countries will fulfill their ODA commitments, take part in project cooperation under the GDI, and scale up inputs in developing countries, especially the least developed countries and small island states. We hope that the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other international and regional development organizations will take an active part in GDI cooperation and provide more funding support for developing countries.Colleagues,Every country has the right to development and everyone has the desire to develop. On the path of development, no country or individual should be left behind. This is the humble aspiration of the GDI and the goal advocated by the UN. While committed to its own development, China will continue to share development opportunities with all countries to achieve common progress of mankind. At this new historical starting point, we will stand with fellow developing countries and make all-out efforts to advance the GDI. Together, we will sound the clarion call for common development and establish fast tracks for development through cooperation. Let us join hands on our journey of implementing the 2030 Agenda and build an even better community with a shared future for mankind.
                

                From September 14 to 16, 2022, President Xi Jinping attended the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Samarkand and paid state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan upon invitation. As the visit came to a conclusion, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi briefed the accompanying journalists on the visit.Wang Yi said that in the mid-autumn season, President Xi Jinping embarked on the trip to Central Asia, which has received international attention. The visit takes place at a time when the world is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century, a protracted COVID-19 pandemic, profound adjustments in major-country relations, the spread and spill-over of geopolitical conflicts and mounting difficulties and challenges facing humanity at large. Domestically, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is soon to be held. The vast land of China is brimming with vigor and vitality. The Chinese people are united in a common effort and ushering in bright prospects for China’s national rejuvenation. Being the first overseas visit by President Xi Jinping since COVID-19 began, the visit is of major significance and the timing of the visit is rather special. It is a major diplomatic action of the CPC Central Committee vis-à-vis Eurasia in light of both domestic and international imperatives, and an important landmark visit undertaken at a crucial and historic juncture. The global media have closely followed the visit with intense coverage. Cooperation, security, development, openness, mutual trust, and respect became the key buzzwords in international mainstream media coverage. International commentary described the choice of Central Asia as President Xi Jinping’s first overseas visit since COVID-19 as one of major strategic significance and a strategic step China has taken to unite with its SCO friends in order to penetrate the attempted encirclement by the United States. It fully shows the strong confidence and influence of President Xi Jinping, and the growing international standing and influence of China.Over three days and two nights, President Xi Jinping flew to Nur-Sultan and then Samarkand and, within a 48-hour stay, attended nearly 30 multilateral and bilateral events with a twin focus on security and development. Despite its brevity, the visit has had many highlights and created fruitful outcomes. With the visit’s facilitation, the expansion of the SCO took a new step forward. The visit also successfully steered China’s relations with relevant countries to new levels. It is a visit that pointed the way forward in turbulent times and reinvigorated the ancient Silk Road. Against the overarching backdrop of turbulence and mounting risks and challenges in today’s world, President Xi Jinping's visit to Central Asia has added vigor and vitality to the Silk Road connecting Asia and Europe and stabilizing factors to the regional and international landscape that are currently at a crossroads. The visit has created more favorable international conditions for China’s new journey toward building a modern socialist country in all respects and fully demonstrated the extraordinary vision and sense of responsibility of a major country and a major political party that care about the world and stay at the forefront of the trend of the times.I. Carry forward the Shanghai Spirit and open a new phase of development of the SCOWang Yi said that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the SCO Charter, and the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-term Good Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation Between SCO Member States. Over the past years, the SCO has carried forward the Shanghai Spirit featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for the diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, and played an active role in and made contributions to Eurasian and international affairs. Meanwhile, today's world has witnessed the rising challenge of unity vs division and cooperation vs confrontation.  The SCO is faced with various tests in safeguarding regional peace and security. Its member states face serious challenges in upholding their own security and stability. Bearing in mind the new circumstances, tasks and difficulties facing the SCO and its member states, President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the Samarkand Summit. The speech focuses on the importance of this milestone year to the SCO in the course of its development, provides insights and guidance on the future of the SCO from a strategic and overall perspective, and puts forward major initiatives and proposals on greater unity among the member states and the future development of the SCO.President Xi Jinping gave an insightful review of the success of the SCO, attributing it to the organization’s commitment to political trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, equality, openness and inclusiveness, and equity and justice, and said these five points fully embody the Shanghai Spirit, which is the source of strength for the development of the SCO, and the fundamental guide that the SCO must continue to follow in the years to come. The commitment to these five points is a practice of true multilateralism that rises above traditional bloc politics. It is an answer to the question of what new type of regional cooperation is required in the new era and how to advance it, offering significant guidance for the SCO's development and the sound and equitable development of international relations.As for the future development of the SCO, President Xi Jinping pointed out that under the new circumstances, the SCO, as an important constructive force in international and regional affairs, should keep itself well-positioned in the face of changing international dynamics, ride on the trend of the times, constantly enhance strategic independence, consolidate and deepen solidarity and cooperation and build a closer SCO community with a shared future. To this end, President Xi Jinping put forward five suggestions, emphasizing that we need to enhance mutual support, expand security cooperation, deepen practical cooperation, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and uphold multilateralism. These suggestions echo the common aspirations of every member state to seek unity, stability and development, and draw a road map for the progress of the SCO and a new blueprint for its cooperation.Through concerted efforts of President Xi Jinping and other participating leaders, the summit adopted over 40 outcome documents covering economy, finance, technology, culture, institution-building, external exchanges and so on. Particularly, under the initiative of the Chinese side, heads of state of the SCO member states adopted four major statements on international energy and food security, tackling climate change, and keeping supply chains secure, stable and diversified. The Chinese side also announced that it is ready to establish a China-SCO base for training counter-terrorism personnel, host a forum on industrial and supply chains, set up a China-SCO Big Data Cooperation Center, and provide developing countries in need with emergency humanitarian assistance of grain and other supplies worth 1.5 billion yuan. These tangible measures meet the needs of various countries, and show that China not only presented the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, but also carried out the initiatives with real actions. At the summit, President Xi Jinping called for continued efforts to achieve the complementarity of the Belt and Road Initiative with national development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives, expand sub-multilateral cooperation and sub-regional cooperation, and create more growth drivers in cooperation. The other countries responded positively, saying that they will continue to tap into the potential of cooperation in various fields, build the SCO into an anchor of regional security and stability, and make greater contributions to world peace and development.It is particularly noteworthy that before the summit, an increasing number of countries had applied for joining the SCO. China and other member states of the SCO together adopted a holistic approach to these applications and conducted equal-footed consultations. At the summit, the SCO accepted Iran as a member state, supported the starting of the procedure for the accession of Belarus, granted Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar the status of SCO dialogue partners, and reached agreement on admitting Bahrain, the Maldives, the UAE, Kuwait and Myanmar as new dialogue partners. This is a new and the largest round of expansion for the SCO. It helps consolidate the standing and influence of the SCO as an organization for regional cooperation with the largest population and the largest landmass in the world, and demonstrates once again the dynamism, ability to unite, and appeal of the Shanghai Spirit. The expansion also fully shows that the SCO is not an isolated and exclusive "small circle", but an open and inclusive "big family". The SCO, as a new type of international organization consisting of 26 countries, has shown stronger vitality and more promising prospects, and will definitely inject more positive energy and new impetus into safeguarding peace and prosperity of the Eurasian continent and the world, and play an exemplary role in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.Samarkand, renowned as the pearl on the Silk Road, witnessed the glory and splendor of the ancient Silk Road. Today, the famous historic city has borne witness to yet another landmark and important moment for the Eurasian continent. Through the concerted efforts of all the parties, the Samarkand Summit had more participating leaders and more outcome documents than any previous summit in the history of the SCO. Uzbekistan, as the rotating chair of the SCO and host country of the summit, attached great importance to the summit and made it a national priority. The Chinese side provided staunch political, logistic and COVID-response support and made positive contributions to the success of the summit. This is an example of how China works with other SCO members in the spirit of solidarity and coordination by means of giving each other support when needed. At the summit, the Samarkand Declaration of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization was signed and released, which fully absorbed the main elements of the series of important initiatives China had made.II. Write a new chapter of good-neighborly friendship between China and Kazakhstan, and between China and Uzbekistan under the guidance of building a community with a shared futureWang Yi said that both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are major Central Asian countries, as well as China's key neighbors to the northwest and comprehensive strategic partners. The two countries are also among the first group of countries to support and jointly contribute to the Belt and Road Initiative. During his visit to Central Asia nine years ago, President Xi Jinping proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative in Kazakhstan, the first time for him to come up with this Initiative, and made a special trip to Samarkand, hence a "Silk Road bond" with the two countries. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan, and between China and Uzbekistan. Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. China’s relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan relations are at a fresh historic starting point. Visiting Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan again after those years and the fact that both countries are on President Xi Jinping’s first overseas trip since the onset of COVID-19 fully shows the high level and uniqueness of China's relations with the two countries, as well as the close friendship and deep trust between him and the heads of state of these two countries.The heads of state of both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan attached great importance to the visit and treated President Xi Jinping as their most honored guest by personally directing and planning the visit and extending full diplomatic protocol and the highest level of reception. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev personally went to the airport to greet him and bid him farewell. He held a grand welcome ceremony at the Ak Orda Presidential Palace and awarded President Xi Jinping with the Order of the Golden Eagle, or "Altyn Qyran" Order, the highest order of Kazakhstan awarded to individuals, and personally invited a famous Kazakh meritorious artist to sing in Chinese the song "Ying Shan Hong", which is known to every household in China. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took time from his busy schedule of receiving more than 10 leaders attending the SCO Summit to greet President Xi Jinping at the airport with a spectacular ceremony. He awarded President Xi Jinping the first Order of Friendship, the highest honor conferred by Uzbekistan on foreign individuals, and invited him to plant an oak tree symbolizing the evergreen friendship between Uzbekistan and China. President Mirziyoyev also designated the prime minister of his government to oversee the entire reception. These special and heart-warming arrangements demonstrate the political will of the two heads of state for friendship with China and the profound goodwill of the people of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan towards China.President Xi Jinping held warm and friendly talks with President Tokayev and President Mirziyoyev, which produced a broad range of practical results. President Xi Jinping signed and issued joint statements respectively with the two presidents, which comprehensively summarize the achievements and experience accumulated during the past 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations and chart the course for future growth of relations. As announced, China and Kazakhstan will work for the goal and vision of building a community with a shared future defined by lasting friendship, a high degree of mutual trust and sharing weal and woe, while China and Uzbekistan will, bearing in mind the long-term development of China-Uzbekistan relations and the future welfare of the two peoples, implement the vision of a community with a shared future at the bilateral level and give bilateral relations a whole new characterization. President Xi Jinping outlined the essential components of what makes a community with a shared future, putting firm mutual support before all else. In Kazakhstan, President Xi Jinping stressed that the unbreakable friendship between China and Kazakhstan will contribute to the growth of positive and progressive forces in the world and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. He stressed that China is ready to work with Kazakhstan to be each other's strong supporters for development and rejuvenation. President Tokayev said that President Xi Jinping's visit demonstrates the two sides' commitment to opening another 30 golden years of Kazakhstan-China relations, which is of special and great significance in the current volatile and complex international environment, Tokayev noted, adding that this will make a new milestone in the history of Kazakhstan-China relations and that Kazakhstan will continue to firmly uphold the one-China policy and be a good partner and good friend that China can always rely on under all circumstances. In Uzbekistan, President Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Uzbekistan have always respected each other, enjoyed good neighborliness and worked in partnership for mutual benefits and that China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to implement the vision of a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future and deepen all-round cooperation for mutual benefit. Mirziyoyev said that President Xi Jinping's historic state visit to Uzbekistan will elevate the Uzbekistan-China comprehensive strategic partnership to a new height and that China is a reliable friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Uzbekistan, adding that Uzbekistan is firmly and unequivocally committed to the one-China principle, and firmly supports China's position on matters concerning its core interests and that Uzbekistan will always be trustworthy as well as a good neighbor, good friend and good partner for China.During the tour, China reached wide-ranging consensus on the future direction and priorities of cooperation with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan respectively and agreed with them to continue to engage in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, speed up the alignment of development strategies, and promote pragmatic cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, energy, railway and connectivity. Nearly 30 bilateral cooperation documents across a broad range of areas, including finance, water conservancy, digital economy, green development, culture, and sub-national cooperation, have been signed. Among them, the memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project marks important progress in the construction of a major transport route in the Eurasian continent. In addition, the completion of the restoration project of historical and cultural sites in Khorezm region, which was commenced during President Xi Jinping's visit to Uzbekistan in 2013, has become another highlight of cultural cooperation between the two sides.Wang Yi said that the launch of the concept of a community with a shared future between China and Kazakhstan and between China and Uzbekistan at the bilateral level is an integral part of the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. It will certainly enable their millennia-old traditional friendship to brim with renewed vigor and vitality and better benefit the Chinese people and the people of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, while making China-Kazakhstan and China-Uzbekistan contributions to regional peace and stability and development.Ⅲ. Deepen strategic communication with all parties to inject positive energy into the peaceful development of the Eurasian continentWang Yi said that President Xi Jinping also held bilateral meetings in Samarkand with the leaders of 10 countries attending the SCO Summit at their request and attended the trilateral meeting between China, Russia and Mongolia. Among them are both old friends with whom President Xi Jinping has met several times in recent years and new friends met for the first time. The meetings covered many topics, reached significant depth and produced substantive results, which play an important role in guiding the growth of bilateral relations and promoting regional peace and stability by setting the direction and outlining the priorities.President Xi Jinping held his second face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this year, which was also the first meeting between the heads of state of China and Russia on the international occasion since the outbreak of the pandemic. The two heads of state positively evaluated the fruitful strategic communication maintained between the two countries this year, and said that they will continue to strongly support each other on issues concerning each other's core interests, strengthen coordination and cooperation within multilateral frameworks, promote the enhancement of solidarity and mutual trust among all parties, and safeguard the common interests of vast developing countries and emerging markets.The heads of state of China, Russia and Mongolia held an in-person meeting for the first time after three years. President Xi Jinping fully recognized the achievements of trilateral cooperation among China, Russia and Mongolia, and put forward four proposals on promoting the trilateral cooperation, stressing the need to firmly grasp the right direction of the trilateral cooperation, elevate cooperation within the framework of the SCO, implement well the projects under the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor, and cultivate more deliverables of the trilateral cooperation.President Xi Jinping met with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon respectively. This is the third time this year that President Xi Jinping and the heads of five Central Asian countries have met, fully reflecting the close ties between China and Central Asian countries. President Xi Jinping reiterated his support for Central Asian countries in safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and security, opposition to any external forces' interference in the internal affairs of Central Asian countries, and support for Central Asian countries in strengthening integrated cooperation. All parties agreed to expand and strengthen the China+Central Asia (C+C5) Meeting mechanism to maintain security and stability in Central Asia and promote common development in the region.President Xi Jinping also met with the leaders of Iran, Belarus, Pakistan, Mongolia, Türkiye and Azerbaijan separately, reaching many new and important common understandings on advancing the development of bilateral relations. They also exchanged views and formed synergy on promoting the political settlement of regional hotspot issues such as Iranian nuclear issue, Afghanistan and the Middle East issues. The Chinese and Belarusian heads of state issued a joint statement and unanimously decided to upgrade China-Belarus relations to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.I would like to point out in particular that in response to the recent attempts by certain countries to undermine China's sovereignty and interfere in China's internal affairs, the leaders of the above-mentioned countries took the initiative to reiterate during their meetings that they will continue to firmly abide by the one-China principle and firmly support China's position on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and other core interests. This shows once again that it is clear to all who stands for fairness and justice. China enjoys abundant support for its just cause.Wang Yi said that so far this year, from the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 to the BRICS Summit, from the High-Level Dialogue on Global Development to the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the SCO in Samarkand, each time we can strongly feel the international community's firm support for China and eager expectation for deepening friendship and cooperation with China. President Xi Jinping, with his far-sighted strategic vision, open and inclusive broad-mindedness, and charismatic personality of valuing goodwill and friendship, has won China more and more understanding, respect and recognition internationally. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has become a constructive force in international relations for dialogue and cooperation, for unity and openness, and for peace and development, and has played an increasingly important role for the long-term stability and sustainable development of the Eurasian continent and the world at large.IV. Expound on the bright future of China's development and look forward to the new journey of a major country and a major political party.Wang Yi said that last year we celebrated the centenary of the founding of the CPC, and many countries were impressed by the CPC's remarkable achievements over the past century. They hoped to find out about the secret of China's "two miracles" of rapid economic development and long-term social stability, and they had profound interest in China's system, path, theory and culture. Next month, the 20th National Congress of the CPC will be convened, which will draw a magnificent blueprint for China's future development. The international community will focus more on China and the CPC.The leaders of the countries who met President Xi Jinping during his visit took the initiative to wish the 20th National Congress of the CPC a full success. They expressed confidence in China's development prospects and the hope to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with China on all fronts. They said they looked forward to China playing a greater role in international affairs. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said that President Xi Jinping is a truly great leader, who enjoys the heartfelt support of the Chinese people, and that China will surely achieve its magnificent goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects as scheduled. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said that President Xi Jinping is a great statesman in today's world, and Uzbekistan is convinced that under President Xi Jinping's wise leadership, China will have not only a bright today but also a brighter tomorrow.On various occasions during this visit, President Xi Jinping shared stories about China and the CPC by presenting China’s history and reality, and theories and practices, and shared experience in state governance with leaders of other countries. It showed the image of a confident, open and progressive major country and major Party on a new journey, and further enhanced understanding of, support for and recognition of the CPC.President Xi Jinping expounded on the significance and overall goals of the 20th National Congress of the CPC. He pointed out that at this national congress, the CPC will fully review the major achievements made and valuable experience gained in China's reform and development endeavors. It will also formulate programs of action and overarching policies to meet China's new development goals on the journey ahead in the new era and the new expectations of the people. President Xi Jinping stressed that we will continue to follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we will continue to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. By doing so, we will create new opportunities for the world with new advances in China's development and contribute our vision and strength to world peace and development and human progress.President Xi Jinping introduced China's reform and development, stressing that China has continued to respond to COVID-19 and promote economic and social development in a well-coordinated way. The fundamentals of China's economy, characterized by strong resilience, enormous potential, ample room for policy adjustment and long-term sustainability, will remain sound. This will greatly boost the stability and recovery of the world economy and provide more market opportunities for other countries. President Xi Jinping pointed out that China has entered a new development stage and is making active efforts to foster a new development paradigm. China stands ready to continue to share development achievements with other parties and learn from each other's development experience. All parties are welcome to board the express train of China's development. China's door of opening-up and friendly cooperation will always be open to the world.President Xi Jinping made an insightful explanation of China's diplomatic visions and propositions. He pointed out that human society "has both sunny and rainy days in its development", described the GSI and the GDI with a clear focus, and called on all countries to stay true to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. He called on all parties to foster global development partnership, and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Regarding certain countries that are obsessed with geopolitical games and bloc confrontation, President Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that we should remain firm in safeguarding the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law, practice the common values of humanity, uphold true multilateralism, jointly improve global governance, reject zero-sum game and bloc politics, and work together to ensure that the international order is more just and equitable.Leaders congratulated China on its outstanding achievements in economic and social development under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, particularly the victory of the battle against extreme poverty and the completion of the building of a moderately prosperous society. They spoke highly of the two great initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping, namely the Belt and Road Initiative and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. They believed that the GDI and the GSI put forward by China are of important strategic significance for solving the risks and challenges facing the world today.Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping's visit, which covers neighboring Central Asia, focuses on the Eurasian continent and reflect global changes, is yet another successful practice and vivid embodiment of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. Over the past ten years since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China, through vigorous and determined endeavor, has overcome difficulties and made pioneering and historic achievements in its diplomatic work. In the new era, China has pursued its development in the context of human development, and constantly pooled the greatest common denominator of the interests of the Chinese people and the people of other countries. China has firmly stood on the right side of history and followed the trend of the times. We have pursued the right path, brought benefits to the world, and enjoyed popular support. The 20th National Congress of the CPC soon to be held will sound a new clarion call, and China's diplomatic cause will also embark on a new journey. We must unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, follow Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, strive to break new ground in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and continuously make new contributions to building a modern socialist country in all respects and promoting world peace and development!
                

                Statement by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of The Shanghai Cooperation OrganizationSamarkand, 16 September 2022Your Excellency President Shavkat Mirziyoyev,Colleagues,I am delighted to attend the meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). I would like to thank you, President Mirziyoyev, for your warm hospitality and thoughtful arrangements. I salute Uzbekistan for the great job it has done to promote SCO cooperation in various fields during its presidency over the past year.Samarkand, renowned as the pearl on the Silk Road, witnessed the glory of the ancient Silk Road, a route that greatly boosted the flow of goods, spread of science and technology, interaction of ideas, and integration of diverse cultures on the Eurasian continent. Indeed, the ancient Silk Road has remained a historical source of inspiration for us SCO member states as we pursue peace and development.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the SCO Charter and 15th anniversary of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation Between the SCO Member States. Over the years, guided by these two founding documents, we have succeeded in exploring a new path for the development of international organizations, and there is much we can draw on from SCO’s rich practices.— Political trust. Guided by the vision of forging enduring friendship and peace among the SCO member states, we respect each other’s core interests and choice of development path and support each other in achieving peace, stability, development and rejuvenation.— Win-win cooperation. We accommodate each other’s interests, stay true to the principle of consultation and cooperation for shared benefits, enhance synergy between our respective development strategies, and keep to the path of win-win cooperation toward common prosperity.— Equality between nations. We are committed to the principle of equality among all countries regardless of their size, consensus-based decision-making, and addressing issues through friendly consultations. We reject the practice of the strong bullying the weak or the big bullying the small.— Openness and inclusiveness. We stand for harmonious coexistence and mutual learning between different countries, nations and cultures, dialogue between civilizations and seeking common ground while shelving differences. We are ready to establish partnership and develop win-win cooperation with other countries and international organizations that share our vision.— Equity and justice. We are committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; we tackle major international and regional issues on the basis of their merits, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own agenda at the expense of other countries’ legitimate rights and interests.These five points fully embody the Shanghai Spirit, namely, mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development. It has been shown that this spirit is the source of strength for the development of the SCO. It is also the fundamental guide we must continue to follow in the years to come. We owe SCO’s remarkable success to the Shanghai Spirit. And we will continue to follow its guidance as we forge ahead.Colleagues,Human society, like the natural world, has both sunny and rainy days in its development. Our world today is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century, and it has entered a new phase of uncertainty and transformation. The once-in-a-century pandemic has continued unabated. Regional conflicts keep flaring up. The Cold War mentality and group politics are resurfacing, so are unilateralism and protectionism. Economic globalization has encountered headwinds. Deficit in peace, development, trust, and governance has grown. Human society has reached a crossroads and faces unprecedented challenges.Under these new conditions, the SCO, as an important constructive force in international and regional affairs, should keep itself well-positioned in the face of changing international dynamics, ride on the trend of the times, strengthen solidarity and cooperation and build a closer SCO community with a shared future.First, we need to enhance mutual support. We should strengthen high-level exchanges and strategic communication, deepen mutual understanding and political trust, and support each other in our efforts to uphold security and development interests. We should guard against attempts by external forces to instigate “color revolution”, jointly oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs under any pretext, and hold our future firmly in our own hands.Second, we need to expand security cooperation. A proverb in Uzbekistan goes to the effect that “With peace, a country enjoys prosperity, just as with rain, the land can flourish.” The Global Security Initiative put forward by China is to address the peace deficit and global security challenges. It calls on all countries to stay true to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. We welcome all stakeholders to get involved in implementing this initiative.We should continue to carry out joint anti-terrorism exercises, crack down hard on terrorism, separatism and extremism, drug trafficking as well as cyber and transnational organized crimes; and we should effectively meet the challenges in data security, biosecurity, outer space security and other non-traditional security domains. China is ready to train 2,000 law enforcement personnel for SCO member states in the next five years, and establish a China-SCO base for training counter-terrorism personnel, so as to enhance capacity-building for law enforcement of SCO member states.We should ensure that the SCO-Afghanistan contact group and the mechanism of coordination and cooperation among Afghanistan’s neighbors continue to play their roles; and we should encourage Afghan authorities to establish a broadly-based and inclusive political structure and remove the ground that breeds terrorism.Third, we need to deepen practical cooperation. To deliver a better life for people of all countries in the region is our shared goal. The Global Development Initiative launched by China aims to focus global attention on development, foster global development partnership, and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development. China is ready to work with all other stakeholders to pursue this initiative in our region to support the sustainable development of regional countries.We need to implement the two statements on safeguarding international energy and food security to be adopted by this summit and better protect energy and food security. China will provide developing countries in need with emergency humanitarian assistance of grain and other supplies worth 1.5 billion RMB yuan.We welcome the Comprehensive Plan for the Implementation of the SCO Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation for 2023-2027 to be adopted at this summit. We should fully implement the cooperation documents in such areas as trade and investment, infrastructure building, protecting supply chains, scientific and technological innovation and artificial intelligence to be adopted within the framework of the summit. It is important to continue our efforts to achieve the complementarity of the Belt and Road Initiative with national development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives, expand sub-multilateral cooperation and sub-regional cooperation, and create more growth drivers in cooperation.We need to ensure implementation of the roadmap for SCO member states to expand shares of local currency settlement, better develop the system for cross-border payment and settlement in local currencies, work for the establishment of an SCO development bank, and thus speed up regional economic integration. Next year, China will host an SCO ministers’ meeting on development cooperation and an industrial and supply chains forum, and will set up the China-SCO Big Data Cooperation Center to create new engines of common development. China stands ready to carry out space cooperation with all other parties and provide satellite data service to support them in agricultural development, connectivity and disaster mitigation and relief.Fourth, we need to enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Exchanges promote integration among civilizations, which, in turn, enables civilizations to advance. We should deepen cooperation in such areas as education, science and technology, culture, health, media, radio and television, ensure the continued success of signature programs such as the youth exchange camp, the women’s forum, the forum on people-to-people friendship and the forum on traditional medicine, and support the SCO Committee on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation and other non-official organizations in playing their due roles. China will build a China-SCO ice and snow sports demonstration zone and host the SCO forums on poverty reduction and sustainable development and on sister cities next year. In the next three years, China will carry out 2,000 free cataract operations for SCO member states and provide 5,000 human resources training opportunities for them.Fifth, we need to uphold multilateralism. Obsession with forming a small circle can only push the world toward division and confrontation. We should remain firm in safeguarding the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law, practice the common values of humanity and reject zero-sum game and bloc politics. We should expand SCO’s exchanges with other international and regional organizations such as the UN, so as to jointly uphold true multilateralism, improve global governance, and ensure that the international order is more just and equitable.Colleagues,The Eurasian continent is home to us all. Upholding its peace and development is the shared goal of countries both in our region and the world at large, and the SCO shoulders an important responsibility in meeting this goal. In recent years, an increasing number of countries have applied to join our SCO family. This fully demonstrates the power of SCO’s vision and the widely shared confidence in its future. By promoting the development and expansion of the SCO and giving full play to its positive impact, we will create strong momentum and new dynamism for ensuring durable peace and common prosperity of the Eurasian continent and the whole world. China supports advancing SCO expansion in an active yet prudent manner, and this includes going through the procedure to admit Iran as a member state, launching the procedure for Belarus’ accession, admitting Bahrain, the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Myanmar as dialogue partners, and granting the relevant applying countries the legal status due to them. We need to seize the opportunity to build consensus, deepen cooperation and jointly create a bright future for the Eurasian continent.Here I wish to express China’s congratulations to India on assuming the next SCO presidency. We will, together with other member states, support India during its presidency.Colleagues,This year, facing a complex and challenging development environment both at home and abroad, China has stayed committed to the general principle of making advances while maintaining stable performance, and it has striven to ensure both effective COVID-19 containment, economic stability and development security. We have continued to respond to COVID-19 and promote economic and social development in a well-coordinated way. Thus, to the greatest extent possible, we have both safeguarded the life and health of the people and ensured overall economic and social development. The fundamentals of China’s economy, characterized by strong resilience, enormous potential, ample room for policy adjustment and long-term sustainability, will remain sound. This will greatly boost the stability and recovery of the world economy and provide more market opportunities for other countries.Next month, the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress. It will be an important meeting to be held at a critical time as China embarks on a new journey toward its second centenary goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects. At this national congress, the Communist Party of China will fully review the major achievements made and valuable experience gained in China’s reform and development endeavors. It will also formulate programs of action and overarching policies to meet China’s new development goals on the journey ahead in the new era and the new expectations of the people. We will continue to follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we will continue to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. By doing so, we will create new opportunities for the world with new advances in China’s development and contribute our vision and strength to world peace and development and human progress.Colleagues,Long as the journey is, we will surely reach our destination when we stay the course. Let us act in the Shanghai Spirit, work for the steady development of the SCO, and jointly build our region into a peaceful, stable, prosperous and beautiful home!Thank you.
                

                Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of China“The land is fertile and crops thriving. Trees flourish, and flowers and fruits abound. A place home to steeds.” This is how Huen Tsang, an eminent Chinese monk in the Tang Dynasty over 1,300 years ago, depicted the richly-endowed Samarkand. In this lovely mid-autumn month, a season of harvest, I will once again visit the beautiful city of Samarkand at the invitation of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to discuss with him plans for closer cooperation between China and Uzbekistan, and to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit.Both China and Uzbekistan are ancient civilizations, and the great Silk Road has borne witness to the friendly exchanges of the two peoples over the past 2,000 years and more. Several historical figures from China traveled west to visit Uzbekistan, including Zhang Qian of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), Huen Tsang of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Chen Cheng of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), leaving their footprints in famous cities like Tashkent, Samarkand and Navoi. During the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), Sayyid Ajall Shams al-Din, a statesman whose ancestral home was in Bukhara, served as the governor of Yunnan province in China. In the mid-14th century, Wu Ru, an authority on astronomy and calendar and a native of Samarkand, participated in the construction of an observatory in Nanjing. These people were trailblazers and pioneers in the China-Uzbekistan friendship, and stories about them are still widely told in both countries.Uzbekistan is a major country at the geopolitical center of Central Asia. Over the last 31 years since gaining independence, Uzbekistan has scored remarkable achievements in national development and rejuvenation. In recent years in particular, under the leadership of President Mirziyoyev, the people of Uzbekistan have embarked on a new journey toward a “New Uzbekistan”. Reform and development in various areas have entered the fast lane. The country has taken on a new look, its people enjoy a better life, and its international standing has risen significantly. As a friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner, China feels truly happy for Uzbekistan. This year marks the 30th anniversary of China-Uzbekistan diplomatic ties. Over the past three decades, the giant tree of our relationship has taken deeper roots and grown more exuberant. The two countries have respected each other, fostered good-neighborliness, strengthened solidarity and pursued mutual benefit. Cooperation across the board has yielded concrete results.— We are good friends sharing close affinity. Since 2016, President Mirziyoyev and I have stayed in close contact and forged a good working relationship and deep personal friendship through meetings, phone calls and correspondence. Under a comprehensive strategic partnership, the two countries have rendered mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests, supported each other’s implementation of development strategies, drawn upon each other’s experience of reform and opening-up, and injected positive energy into regional development.— We are good partners pursuing common development. China is the biggest trading partner and a major investor for Uzbekistan. Two-way trade exceeded US$8 billion in 2021, approached US$5 billion in the first half of this year, and is on course to reach the US$10-billion goal set for 2022. Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative has been fruitful, and major projects are making steady progress. All four lines of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline run through Uzbekistan. The tunnel on the Angren-Pap railway line, the longest tunnel in Central Asia, has been successfully completed. More transport potential is being unleashed from the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway and the China-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan railway. And preparations for the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project are well under way. Uzbekistan is thus transforming from a land-locked to a land-linked country. The two sides have also carried out robust cooperation in new energy, agriculture, finance and modern telecommunications, delivering greater benefits to the two peoples.— We are a good example of dialogue between civilizations. The two sides have held a wide range of exchanges including art festivals, culture promotion events, exhibitions and seminars. Cooperation is flourishing with regard to sending students, translating publications, making films, translating TV series, and conducting sub-national interactions and personnel training, which has effectively brought the two peoples still closer. In recent years, China has trained for Uzbekistan over 6,500 professionals of various fields. They are taking an active part in Uzbekistan’s reform and development endeavors. Confucius Institutes have been set up in Tashkent and Samarkand where a great number of Uzbeks learned the Chinese language and they have become envoys of friendship between our two countries. Cooperation in tourism is taking off, bringing more Chinese to the beautiful land of Uzbekistan. The preservation and restoration of historical sites in Khiva, a project launched during my visit to Samarkand in 2013, has been successfully concluded, further augmenting the charm of this ancient city.— We are good brothers supporting each other in times of need. China and Uzbekistan, with their interests closely entwined, have stood together through thick and thin. We have maintained close coordination both bilaterally and in such regional and multilateral frameworks as the SCO. We have worked together to oppose external interference, combat the three forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, and tackle transnational organized crimes and drug trafficking. By strengthening intelligence sharing and expanding personnel training, we have jointly forged a strong shield of security. In face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our two countries have supported each other and conducted active cooperation. Chinese vaccines, which can now be jointly produced with Uzbekistan, have played a major role in Uzbekistan’s fight against the virus, and a Chinese COVID drug has been approved for clinical use in Uzbekistan, providing effective protection for the life of people in both countries.Over 2,000 years of friendly exchanges and three decades of mutually beneficial cooperation show that enhancing China-Uzbekistan cooperation on all fronts conforms to the trend of history and meets the fundamental interests of both peoples. Standing at the intersection of past and future, we are full of confidence and expectation for a more promising prospect of China-Uzbekistan relations.First, we need to enhance mutual support and strengthen the bond of mutual trust. We need to set out the blueprint for China-Uzbekistan relations in the new era from a strategic and long-term perspective. We need to intensify high-level exchanges, increase mutual political trust, deepen the sharing of governance experience, and continue to render mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests. China firmly supports Uzbekistan in pursuing a development path suited to its own national conditions and opposes interference in Uzbekistan’s internal affairs by any force.Second, we need to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to pursue common development and prosperity. We should forge a better synergy between our development strategies and jointly explore new pathways to bilateral cooperation in economy, trade, investment, key projects and other fields. China has entered a new development stage and is making active efforts to foster a new development paradigm. Uzbekistan is welcome to board the express train of China’s development and share its development opportunities. Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our two sides could use this opportunity and harness the momentum to further flesh out the bilateral cooperation and pursue high-quality development together. We also need to expand cooperation on poverty reduction and alleviation so that more people in both countries benefit from our mutually beneficial cooperation.China hopes to work with Uzbekistan to actively implement the Global Development Initiative, and take concerted actions to safeguard the interests of developing countries and foster a balanced, coordinated and inclusive development landscape that embraces win-win cooperation, works for all and delivers common prosperity.Third, we need to strengthen security cooperation to defuse risks and challenges. Our two sides need to deepen cooperation in the security field and unequivocally reject attempts by any force to undermine regional security, to foster a secure external environment for the development of both countries. Afghanistan is a mutual neighbor of China and Uzbekistan. A peaceful, stable, growing and prosperous Afghanistan is in our shared interests. China appreciates and supports the unique role of Uzbekistan in resolving the issue of Afghanistan. We stand ready to work with Uzbekistan to put the Global Security Initiative into action, fend off new threats and challenges, and uphold peace, stability and international fairness and justice.Fourth, we need to promote cultural exchanges to enhance people-to-people connectivity. Between relatives and friends alike, with closer interaction the affinity grows. The China-Uzbekistan friendship enjoys a time-honored history and our cooperation on people-to-people exchanges has a solid foundation and bright prospects. We need to expand cooperation in the areas of media, education, health, culture, tourism, press, archeology and at the sub-national level, open culture centers in each other’s countries at an earlier time and set up a Luban Workshop in Uzbekistan, to foster a multi-faceted framework of people-to-people exchanges. This will help sustain the growth of China-Uzbekistan relations and build a lasting friendship between our peoples.During my visit to Uzbekistan this time, I will attend the SCO Samarkand Summit. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in these two documents, the SCO has acted on the Shanghai Spirit, stayed true to its founding mission, and promoted the joint efforts among its member states for stability and development. The SCO has set a fine example of a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, and proved itself an important and constructive force in the Eurasian region and in international affairs.Since assuming SCO presidency, despite the impacts from COVID-19, Uzbekistan has strengthened communication and coordination with other member states, made solid efforts on various fronts, and preserved the SCO’s momentum of sound and steady development. China applauds Uzbekistan for its efforts. I am confident that with the joint efforts of all sides, the Samarkand Summit will produce fruitful outcomes and make greater contribution to building an even closer SCO community with a shared future and to peace, stability, development and prosperity of our region.As the saying goes, when your heart knows its direction, the distance to destination will never be long. Bearing in mind the original aspiration upon the establishment of our diplomatic relations, China will work with Uzbekistan to seize the historical opportunities, forge ahead side by side on the path of national development and rejuvenation, and make joint efforts toward the goal of building a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future.
                

                Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaIn the charming season of autumn, I will be making a state visit to the friendly country of Kazakhstan at the invitation of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. After an interval of five years, it will be my fourth visit to the beautiful country known for its vast steppe, majestic landscape and hospitable people. I very much look forward to the visit.Bound together by mountains and rivers and common interests, China and Kazakhstan are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. For thousands of years, the two peoples have had amicable ties, jointly writing an epic of east-west interactions along the ancient Silk Road. Huen Tsang, an eminent Tang Dynasty monk (602-664), and Chen Cheng, a Ming Dynasty envoy (1365-1457), both set foot on Kazakhstan. Al-Farabi the “Eastern Aristotle”, Abai Kunanbayev the “sage poet”, and other towering cultural figures of Kazakhstan enjoy widespread fame in China. To this day, their stories are still being told among the two peoples.This year marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. Over the past three decades, we have braved wind and rain, with our hands always held firmly together. Our interactions and cooperation have become ever more vibrant, and we have travelled an extraordinary path side by side.— Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan relations have made big strides. We have continuously advanced our relationship from good neighbors to strategic partners and to permanent comprehensive strategic partners. This incomparable characterization of our ties has enabled us to develop a new type of state-to-state relations featuring mutual respect, good-neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times, and win-win cooperation. We always give each other unwavering support on the core issues bearing on our respective sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. We always respect each other’s choice of development path based on national conditions. And we always take pleasure in each other’s sustained progress in development and national rejuvenation. We are friends to trust and partners to count on for each other, and our peoples always stand shoulder to shoulder with each other.—Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan cooperation has yielded remarkable results. In recent years, China has been solidly one of Kazakhstan’s leading partners for trade and investment. Navigating the impact of COVID-19, we were able to again bring our bilateral trade above the US$25 billion mark last year, jointly giving a boost to global economic recovery. China and Kazakhstan are pioneers in production capacity and investment cooperation; our cooperation list includes 52 projects worth a total of more than US$21.2 billion. We have completed a number of major strategic projects, such as the 100-MW Zhanatas wind farm, the JAC automobile factory, and Shymkent Oil Refinery modernization. They have been a strong driving force for economic and social progress in Kazakhstan, and have delivered tangible benefits to our two peoples.—Over the past 30 years, China and Kazakhstan have built extensive infrastructure links. We have put in place a multidimensional transportation network composed of road, railway, aviation, and oil and gas pipelines. And we are resolved to build a Eurasian land-sea multimodal “transportation artery” to offer convenient and efficient services. At all of our five road crossings and two rail crossings, normal cargo flows have resumed. And we are in close communication about opening another rail crossing. At the China-Kazakhstan International Logistics Base in the eastern Chinese port of Lianyungang, products from Kazakhstan set sail for the Pacific Ocean. The China-Europe freight trains are running through Kazakhstan via more routes, making an important contribution to the stability of global industrial and supply chains.—Over the past 30 years, China-Kazakhstan friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. In Kazakhstan, there are five Confucius Institutes; in China, four universities have opened institutes on Kazakhstan studies and two have added the Kazakh language as a major. The heart-warming story of Xian Xinghai and Bakhtzhan Baikadamov, two great composers in our respective countries, has been turned into a movie. Dr. Saulebek Kabilbekov of Kazakhstan has been working for 24 years in the Daqing Ophthalmology Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, treating nearly 200,000 Chinese patients. China and Kazakhstan will soon establish cultural centers in each other’s countries, and Kazakhstan will host a center of traditional medicine and a Luban Workshop. Our cultural and people-to-people exchanges will make greater strides, and the friendship between our peoples will continue to thrive on an increasingly solid foundation.Having stood the test of the changing circumstances and the passage of time, China-Kazakhstan relations have long become rock-solid. We should cherish this hard-won achievement, and work harder to carry on the cause of friendship between our two countries. During my upcoming visit, I will have in-depth discussions with President Tokayev on how to further the China-Kazakhstan permanent comprehensive strategic partnership and how to advance our mutually beneficial cooperation across the board. We will set out plans for working together to promote China-Kazakhstan relations with the objective and vision of building a China-Kazakhstan community with a shared future.First, we need to carry forward our good-neighborly friendship. Deep political mutual trust is the bedrock of the steady and sustained development of China-Kazakhstan relations. China is willing to work with Kazakhstan to make top-level designs for the relationship from a strategic and long-term perspective, maintain close high-level interactions, and enhance exchanges and cooperation between our governments, legislatures, political parties and localities at various levels. We should make good use of the regular Prime Ministers’ Meetings and the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee and its sub-committees, continue to give each other firm support on issues concerning our respective core interests and major concerns, and make continuous efforts to cement the political foundation of China-Kazakhstan relations.Second, we need to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation. Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative that I first proposed during my visit to Kazakhstan in 2013. From laying the groundwork to building pillars and frameworks, to delivering results on the ground, and to achieving sustainable progress, the Belt and Road Initiative has become a platform for international cooperation that is open, inclusive, mutually beneficial and promotes win-win cooperation and a global public good widely welcomed by the international community. Setting our sight beyond the pandemic, China would like to partner with Kazakhstan to remain pioneers in Belt and Road cooperation. We should improve investment and trade facilitation, fully unleash the potential of border ports and cross-border transportation, and cultivate new sources of growth such as artificial intelligence, big data, digital finance, e-commerce and green energy. We should commit ourselves to a series of new quality projects that are high-standard, sustainable, and beneficial to the people, bring bilateral cooperation to a higher level, and put the Global Development Initiative into action, so as to contribute our shares to world economic recovery.Third, we need to firmly safeguard common security. In the face of complex regional and international landscapes, only by embracing unity and cooperation can we overcome difficulties of our times and resolve challenges in security governance. China would like to deepen law enforcement, security and defense cooperation with Kazakhstan. Guided by the Global Security Initiative, we should act on the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to promote the implementation of the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China+Central Asia. We should join hands to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crimes, and ensure the security of oil and gas pipelines and other large cooperation projects and their personnel. We should resolutely oppose interference by external forces and work together for lasting peace and long-term stability of our region.Fourth, we need to strengthen international coordination in all respects. We need to enhance coordination within multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the SCO, CICA, and China+Central Asia. We should exchange views timely on international governance, food security, energy security, industrial and supply chains stability, and regional hotspots. We should reject unilateralism and bloc confrontation, and jointly push for an international order that is more just and more equitable.The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 20th National Congress soon. It will be a gathering of great significance at an important moment as the CPC embarks on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects and marching toward the second centenary goal. We are glad to see that the construction of a New Kazakhstan has been fully launched, and that Kazakhstan is making strides toward the goal of becoming one of the world’s top 30 most developed states. China stands ready to continue to share development achievements with Kazakhstan and learn from each other’s development experience. China’s door of opening-up and friendly cooperation will always be open to Kazakhstan.As a Kazakh proverb goes, “Friendship is an inexhaustible wealth.” China believes that as long as we keep to the principle of good-neighborly friendship and deepen all-round win-win cooperation, we will surely usher in a more splendid thirty years in China-Kazakhstan relations.
                

                On September 8, 2022, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong attended and addressed the second China-Pakistan Think Tank Forum online. The Forum was co-hosted by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad of Pakistan and the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. His speech went as follows:Over the past year, China-Pakistan relations have stood various tests, and our friendship remains rock-solid. Three things impressed me most:First, China made all-out efforts to help Pakistan after it was hit by the floods. Since June this year, Pakistan has been stricken by the worst flood disaster in decades, which has caused 1,000 plus deaths and affected over 33 million people. Satellite images showed that one-eighth of Pakistan was flooded. Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan His Excellency Nong Rong told me that when he accompanied Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visiting the disaster areas on the plane, he saw the vast rural areas in Sindh Province flooded as an ocean. I also learned from the TV news that in disaster-stricken areas, heavy rains and floods have destroyed bridges and roads, interrupted traffic, inundated farmland, swept away houses, and displaced people from home and students from schools. The Chinese people, deeply understand what the Pakistani people have suffered, are worried and in sorrow. And facing the floods, the Pakistani people stayed united saving themselves and quickly began to rebuild their homes, demonstrating their indomitable national character. Such scenes are admirable.China and Pakistan are ironclad brothers with a long tradition of helping and supporting each other. We will never forget that in the wake of the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Pakistan took out all tents in its stock and promptly sent them to the disaster-hit areas in China by military aircraft. As a Chinese saying goes, "Receiving drips of water when in need, and I shall return the kindness with a spring", we see the current difficulties faced by Pakistan, our ironclad brothers, as our own difficulties. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent messages of condolence to President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, respectively. Under the social and livelihood cooperation framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has provided 4,000 tents, 50,000 blankets and 50,000 pieces of waterproof tarp to Pakistan. They have been delivered to the frontline of disaster relief.On the late night of August 22, when Pakistani Ambassador to China H.E. Mr. Moin ul Haque contacted me and asked for emergency assistance from China, we took action in the early morning to fully support Pakistan's fight against floods. After emergency coordination by the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), China provided 100-million-yuan emergency humanitarian assistance for Pakistan. The first batch of 3,000 tents out of 25,000 tents was shipped to Pakistan from Sichuan by military aircraft at the end of August and was put into use in the disaster-hit areas. In light of the development of the disaster, the CIDCA has provided additional 300-million-yuan emergency humanitarian assistance. Efforts to provide other urgently-needed materials such as vegetables and tents are underway.The Chinese people also actively lent a helping hand. A few hours after the Pakistani Embassy in China opened a dedicated bank account for Prime Minister's Flood Relief Fund 2022, it received a combined donation of one million yuan. A schoolboy named Luan Mingxuan in Beijing donated all his pocket money. Chinese non-governmental rescue teams spontaneously headed to Pakistan for disaster relief, and Chinese enterprises in Pakistan took the initiative to repair roads and bridges in the affected areas. Recently, Prime Minister Shehbaz also expressed condolences over the casualties caused by the earthquake in Luding, Sichuan Province. A ruthless flood disaster can bring out the best of humanity. The friendship between China and Pakistan, which is higher than mountains, deeper than sea and sweeter than honey, has been verified again. As a Chinese saying goes, "If brothers are firmly united, they could be like a knife that can cut through metal", I believe that our Pakistani brothers will be able to prevail over the disaster and rebuild their homes.Second, the CPEC is effectively supporting Pakistan's economic development and social stability. Not long ago, the Karot Hydropower Plant project, the first of its kind under the CPEC, was completed and put into operation after seven years of construction, bringing thousands of job opportunities to the local people. With an average annual energy output of about 3.2 billion kWh, the plant will provide cheap and clean energy for 5 million local households. It is estimated that the annual carbon dioxide emission can be reduced by 3.5 million tons, which will effectively help Pakistan improve its energy security and promote green transformation.Now, the CPEC has entered the stage of high-quality development. Prime Minister Shehbaz, attaching great importance to the construction of the CPEC, has visited the Gwadar Port twice and held a symposium for Chinese-funded enterprises, during which he coordinated and responded to the demands of enterprises. Investment promotion for the Rashakai Special Economic Zone is progressing smoothly, and solid steps are being taken to advance cooperation in industries, agriculture, society and people's livelihood, thus making sustained and new contributions to Pakistan's industrialization and modernization.Third, Pakistan firmly supports the Chinese side on issues concerning China's core interests such as Taiwan and Xinjiang. Last month, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi paid a sneaky visit to China's Taiwan region. It seriously violated China's sovereignty, interfered in China's internal affairs and jeopardized peace across the Taiwan Strait. The Pakistani government, parliament and people from all political parties have come forward without hesitation, to reaffirm their commitment to the one-China principle, and together with more than 100 countries in the world, to speak out for justice. Regarding the recently released so-called Xinjiang-related assessment by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spoke up for China at the earliest opportunity, offering China invaluable support on Xinjiang-related issues. I grew up in Xinjiang. Of all people, the people in Xinjiang, whatever their ethnic backgrounds, are in the best position to tell the world what the human rights conditions are like in Xinjiang. Anyone who has been to Xinjiang says that Xinjiang is a nice place. Over the past five years, there has not been any terrorist incident in Xinjiang. This summer, Xinjiang was the most popular destination for domestic tourists, and rumors spread by the United States and other Western countries fell apart.Under the intertwined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis and the beggar-thy-neighbor financial policies of some developed countries, issues related to the security of food, energy, finance, industrial and supply chains and ecology have become increasingly prominent. Many Asian countries encounter rising food prices, shortage of chemical fertilizers and climbing energy prices. Some Asian countries have seen continued depreciation of their currencies, declining foreign reserves and high inflation. The rising financial risks have been transmitted to the people's livelihood, causing political turmoil in some countries. Some western countries attempted to build "a small yard with high fences" and decouple with others. As a result, the regional industrial and supply chains are at risk of breaking. Against this backdrop, as all-weather strategic cooperative partners, China and Pakistan need to make efforts in the following aspects:- Strengthen solidarity, cooperation and mutual support. The two sides should maintain the tradition of high-level exchanges, firmly support each other in safeguarding respective core interests, and be solid strategic support for each other. China is ready to share its experience in state governance with Pakistan and fully support Pakistan's disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction.- Jointly pursue high-quality CPEC cooperation. The two sides should make joint efforts to strengthen industrial cooperation and forge secure and stable industrial and supply chains; step up cooperation on law enforcement and security to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan; and jointly share "CPEC stories" to let lies and rumors fall apart.- Take the lead in implementing the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). The two sides should strengthen cooperation in poverty alleviation, food security, pandemic response and vaccine, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, connectivity and other fields, and should take the lead in implementing the 32 deliverables of the High-level Dialogue on Global Development. It's important to implement the GSI, stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, act on true multilateralism, and contribute our strengths to maintaining peace and tranquility in the region and the world at large. An old Chinese saying goes, "Faith will move a mountain". The founding father of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah once said that "We are not afraid of the deep sea or the fire, because we believe in the sun and the future." I am convinced that with the joint efforts of friends from all walks of life in both countries, including scholars from think-tanks, China-Pakistan relations will surely usher in a brighter future!*                     *                    *Acting Director of the China Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan Bilal Akram Shah expressed condolences to the victims of the earthquake on Sept. 5 in Luding, China's Sichuan province, and extended sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured. Bilal spoke highly of China-Pakistan relations, and expressed sincere gratitude for China's much-needed support for Pakistan in fighting floods and disaster relief. Bilal said, Pakistan appreciates the GSI and the GDI, both proposed by President Xi Jinping. Conflict and confrontation will not bring benefits to any country. Instead, cooperation and development are the mainstream of the times. Pakistan is ready to continue to work with China to deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, and promote Belt and Road cooperation, especially the high-quality CPEC cooperation, so as to make positive contributions to regional peace and stability.
                

                Your Excellency State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,Your Excellency Under-Secretary-General Miguel de Serpa Soares,Distinguished guests,It gives me great pleasure to join you in this conference to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the opening for signature of UNCLOS. Just now, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi offered important views and proposed pioneering initiatives on upholding the principles and spirit of UNCLOS and advancing global maritime governance. The opinions shared by Under-Secretary-General Soares in his address also give us much food for thought.The UNCLOS negotiations were the first major international legislative process China took part in after the restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations. China was one of the first countries that signed UNCLOS in December 1982, and ratified the Convention in 1996, giving a strong boost to its conclusion and entry-into-force. As a State Party to UNCLOS, China has fully and faithfully implemented UNCLOS, and proved itself an active participant, builder and contributor to the Convention and its mechanisms.First, China has constructed a matrix of maritime legislation to facilitate UNCLOS implementation on the ground. In accordance with the provisions and spirit of UNCLOS, China has promulgated the Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone and the Law on the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf. China has also introduced the Marine Environment Protection Law, the Fisheries Law, the Sea Areas Administration Law and other important maritime laws for the purpose of strengthening the protection of the marine environment and preservation of marine resources. In recent years, by promulgating the Law on the Deep Seafloor Exploration, introducing the Coast Guard Law, and revising the Maritime Traffic Safety Law, China has further strengthened its maritime legislation system consistent with UNCLOS and other international law.Second, China has ensured standard operation of marine scientific research and worked together with other developing countries to advance human knowledge of the ocean. China has continued to strengthen management of marine scientific research in accordance with UNCLOS, and actively engaged in cooperation on marine scientific research. China has built joint maritime research centers with the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Tanzania, among others, and assisted Nigeria, Mozambique, Seychelles and Madagascar in conducting scientific research on the continental shelf. Through the participation in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030), China has contributed its share to advance the learning and protection of the ocean.Third, China has worked to protect humanity’s blue homeland and followed a sustainable approach to fisheries development. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, China has stepped up its participation in the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities of the United Nations Environment Programme to promote clean and beautiful oceans across the globe. China has joined regional fisheries management organizations including in the North Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, and committed itself to sustainable development of fisheries on the high seas and a zero-tolerance approach to illegal fishing. China is actively studying the accession to the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.Fourth, China has supported the capacity building of the three UNCLOS bodies to facilitate the efficient functioning of the Convention. China has by now acquired five prospecting and exploration mining areas from the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and contributed two reserved areas on its part. Together with the ISA, China has built the world’s first joint training and research center on deep seas. China has firmly upheld Annex I Article 5 of the rules of procedure of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), and submitted to the Commission preliminary information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, China has contributed its wisdom and strength to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) with the submission of written statements on relevant advisory opinions. As the largest funding contributor of the ISA and the ITLOS, China has always paid its membership contributions on time and in full, providing strong financial support to the functioning of the two institutional bodies.China has all along maintained that maritime disputes shall be handled through negotiation and consultation by the parties directly concerned. China does not accept or recognize the so-called “award” of the South China Sea arbitration, which is for the very purpose of upholding the authority and integrity of UNCLOS.Fifth, China has protected the freedom and safety of navigation and ensured smooth international shipping. China respects and supports the freedoms of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in its surrounding sea areas under international law. China actively implements UNCLOS and the relevant provisions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and has acceded to almost all conventions under the IMO framework. China has steadily boosted maritime rescue and other services, and significantly improved the conditions for navigation safety. China has been deeply involved in work related to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, and has actively carried out naval escorts in the Gulf of Aden. Over the years, China has worked proactively to ensure and protect the navigation rights of all countries in different sea areas, and there has never been a problem with navigation in the sea areas within its jurisdiction.Distinguished guests,As President Xi Jinping pointed out, the blue planet humans inhabit is not divided into islands by the oceans, but connected by the oceans to form a community with a shared future. At present, global transformation unseen in a century is evolving at an accelerated pace, and new global maritime issues keep emerging. We must accurately interpret and apply UNCLOS in its entirety and in good faith, and give balanced consideration to UNCLOS, other maritime treaties and general international law. We should bear in mind the Convention’s original goal of upholding the interests of mankind as a whole, oppose the distortion and abuse of UNCLOS, reject the practice of double standards and selective application, and discard the mindset of “might is right”. We should strengthen international cooperation, balance marine environmental protection and utilization, safeguard global food and energy security, attach higher importance to new forms of ocean utilization including seawater desalination and tidal energy, and take credible steps to raise developing countries’ ability to learn about, utilize and protect the sea and participate in global maritime governance.We need to faithfully uphold the purposes and principles of UNCLOS. UNCLOS gives due regard for the sovereignty of all States and aims to promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans and realize a just and equitable international economic order. UNCLOS has established important principles including peaceful uses of the seas, freedom of the high seas and the international seabed as the common heritage of mankind. All parties should follow the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, duly exercise their rights under the Convention, fulfill their obligations under the Convention in good faith, reject the law of the jungle at sea, and oppose the attempt to threaten other country’s sovereignty and security by using the sea.We need to strictly abide by the regime on navigation stipulated in UNCLOS. UNCLOS has stipulated the regime on navigation for various sea areas including the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and high seas. Foreign ships enjoy innocent passage in the territorial sea, but such passage shall not be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. They enjoy freedom of navigation in the exclusive economic zone, but shall have due regard to the coastal State’s sovereign rights over natural resources and jurisdiction over marine scientific research and environmental protection, among others. All parties enjoy freedom of navigation in the high seas, but must comply with such requirements as “the high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes”. In exercising navigation rights in different sea areas, all parties should fully abide by the provisions of UNCLOS in letter and spirit; otherwise the integrity and authority of UNCLOS will be undermined. Even if one is not a State Party to UNCLOS, it should not underscore only their navigation rights while ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of coastal States. The attempts to misinterpret the regime on sea areas established by UNCLOS and play up the so-called freedom of navigation issues are driven purely by ill intentions. China respects the lawful navigation rights of all countries, but firmly opposes certain country’s move to threaten China’s sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation.We need to accurately apply the dispute settlement mechanism of UNCLOS in good faith. UNCLOS advocates “to settle, in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, all issues relating to the law of the sea”. The parties to a dispute are the owners of the dispute settlement procedures. Only when the procedures are approved and accepted by the parties concerned, can they be truly effective in settling the dispute. All parties concerned and international institutions should honor the principle of State consent, act in line with the realities of the dispute among regional countries, and accurately apply the dispute settlement procedures in good faith, and must not overstep or abuse their mandate.Distinguished guests,Standing at a new historical starting point and faced with new circumstances and challenges, China is ready to work with all parties to uphold the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, fully and accurately implement the provisions of UNCLOS, meet the challenges of the era, steadily improve global maritime governance rules, and build a maritime community with a shared future.To conclude, I wish this conference a full success. Thank you!
                

                Remarks by State Councilor Wang Yi at the Coordinators’ Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions ofThe Eighth Ministerial Conference ofThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)18 August 2022Your Excellency Madam Aïssata Tall Sall, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal,Your Excellencies representatives of the sub-regional members of the  Bureau of the Assembly of the African Union and representatives of  the African Co-Chairs of FOCAC,Your Excellency Madam Monique Nsanzabaganwa, Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission,Your Excellencies African Diplomatic Envoys in China,Welcome to the Coordinators’ Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Eighth FOCAC Ministerial Conference. I am so happy to meet you, my African brothers and sisters online. Last November, with the concerted efforts of China and Africa, the Eighth FOCAC Ministerial Conference was successfully convened in Dakar, Senegal. We adopted four outcome documents including the Dakar Declaration. President Xi Jinping announced the launch of nine programs for China-Africa cooperation. It was a highly cordial and results-oriented conference, one of great significance for growing our traditional friendship, cementing our solidarity and cooperation, and building a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era. It has been over half a year since the conference was held. We are pleased to see that, despite the evolving international situation, rising global challenges and repeated external disturbances, China and Africa have stayed our course in enhancing solidarity and focusing on cooperation. We have made good progress in implementing the outcomes of the conference. The people in Africa are getting real benefits.  —Together, we have safeguarded international fairness and justice. In the face of the various forms of hegemonic and bullying practices, China and Africa have stood with each other shoulder to shoulder. China appreciates the firm commitment of African countries to the one-China principle and your strong support for China’s efforts to safeguard sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. China has also spoken up for our African brothers at the UN and other multilateral settings, upholding justice and opposing unwarranted interference and unilateral sanctions against Africa. In solidarity and coordination, China and Africa have become a pillar force in defending the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, upholding the purposes of the UN Charter, and advocating multilateralism and international fairness and justice. —Together, we have kept our focus on development cooperation. We have pushed forward our cooperation on infrastructure, and completed several major projects since the Dakar Conference, including the Foundiougne Bridge in Senegal, the Nairobi Expressway, the Kribi-Lolabe Highway in Cameroon, and the 10th of Ramadan LRT in Egypt. All these have lent a strong boost to Africa’s industrialization process. China is making steady progress in implementing all the pledges it made in Dakar, despite various difficulties and disturbances. Over three billion has been delivered out of the 10 billion US dollars of credit facilities pledged to African financial institutions, and nearly 2.5 billion US dollars of loans were channeled to Africa’s priority programs. More than two billion of the 10 billion US dollars of trade finance has been allocated, and China’s import of African goods within seven months reached 70.6 billion US dollars. Chinese companies have invested 2.17 billion US dollars in Africa. We are prepared to, through the IMF’s two Trusts, re-channel 10 billion US dollars of its SDR to Africa, and encourage the IMF to direct China’s contributions to Africa. —Together, we have tackled the global food crisis. So far this year, China has signed exchange of letters with 12 African countries on zero tariff for 98 percent of their export items to China. We have provided emergency food assistance to Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea. More African agricultural produce has reached the Chinese market through the “green lanes”. The first four China-Africa joint centers for modern agro-technology exchange, demonstration and training were launched. Chinese businesses are increasing their investment in Africa’s agricultural sector, growing more grains, and through the initiative of “100 companies in 1,000 villages”, helping create jobs, reduce poverty and improve livelihood for the rural households in Africa. —Together, we have built a strong shield against COVID-19. China has provided 189 million doses of vaccines to 27 African countries. Joint production of vaccines in Africa now has an annual capacity of about 400 million doses. The Africa CDC Headquarters building has topped out and is expected to be completed early next year. We have concluded upgrading the China-Guinea Friendship Hospital and completed the preliminary procedures for hospitals in South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Malawi to pair up with Chinese hospitals. China has made 332 appointments of medical personnel to Africa; the nearly 1,000 Chinese medical experts in Africa have provided services on 250,000 clinical cases, conducted more than 30,000 operations, treated patients in 4,500 critical cases, and trained 3,600 participants from the local medical and healthcare community. African students taking courses in Chinese colleges are returning to their campuses in China. Fourteen Chinese vocational schools have forged partnerships with 13 African higher education institutions. —Together, we have advanced resilient and sustainable development. We have expanded our cooperation on solar, wind and other clean energy sources. A number of key projects, including the Kafue Lower Gorge Power Station in Zambia have entered into operation. We have held an excellent seminar on building Africa’s Great Green Wall. In countries including Botswana and Burkina Faso, we are carrying out South-South cooperation for addressing climate change. In Seychelles, we are building a low-carbon demonstration zone. In Madagascar and Mozambique, we have supported their response to hurricanes, and helped enhance capacity for disaster preparedness and relief.—Together, we have enhanced regional peace and stability. China has put forward the Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa, appointed its Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Affairs, and supported countries in the region in holding the Horn of Africa Peace Conference. The second China-Africa Peace and Security Forum and a workshop on security in the Gulf of Guinea were successfully held. China has continued to provide military aid to countries in Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, and policing equipment to countries including the Central African Republic and Namibia. All of this has helped boost the capacity of countries in the region for preserving peace and stability with their own strength. Dear colleagues and dear friends, these achievements in our cooperation have not come easily. And we have much more to look forward to in the future. Fruitful China-Africa cooperation will add fresh impetus to global development, generate positive energy for world stability, and bring new hopes to people around the world. We are confident that China-Africa friendship will stand any test of winds and storms. It will continue to be the backbone in South-South cooperation and a fine example in international relations.  Later this year, the Communist Party of China will hold its 20th National Congress, thus ushering in a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the African Union (AU), and Africa will embrace new development opportunities. At this new historical starting point, China and Africa need to stand even closer with each other, press ahead toward common development and rejuvenation, and truly build a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era. Here I wish to take this opportunity to share with you the following five suggestions:First, we need to uphold sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and enhance solidarity and mutual support. China will continue to follow the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and pursuing the greater good and shared interests, put forth by President Xi Jinping. China will always be Africa’s partner of mutual respect, equality and sincere cooperation. We will firmly support African countries in pursuing your own development paths and seeking strength through unity. China supports the AU in joining the G20 and supports Uganda in hosting a successful high-level meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement. We will work with Africa to carry forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, practice true multilateralism and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.Second, we need to take concrete actions to promote common development. China keeps its word with real actions, and will continue to take meeting Africa’s needs as the purpose of our cooperation with Africa. We will work with Africa to fully implement the “nine programs” and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China will waive the 23 interest-free loans for 17 African countries that had matured by the end of 2021. We welcome and support the decision of Tanzania and Zambia to reactivate the Tazara Railway. China will continue to actively support and participate in the construction of major infrastructure in Africa through financing, investment and assistance. We will also continue to increase imports from Africa, support the greater development of Africa’s agricultural and manufacturing sectors, and expand cooperation in emerging industries such as the digital economy, health, green and low-carbon sectors. In response to the shared aspiration of developing countries, President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Development Initiative, and announced that China will upgrade the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund to a Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and further replenish the Fund. China has started developing a pool of global development projects, and welcomes application from African countries with prospective projects. We will also publish a China-Africa action plan on shared development in due course.To help address food shortage in Africa, the Chinese government has decided to provide, within this year, a new tranche of food assistance to the 17 African countries in need, and will encourage more Chinese firms to invest in agricultural production and processing in Africa to help realize food self-sufficiency.Third, we need to uphold independence and jointly promote peace in the region. China will continue to support solving African issues in the African way. We oppose interference by outside forces in African countries’ internal affairs, and oppose stoking confrontation and conflict in Africa. China will speed up the delivery of military aid to the AU and regional countries, help Africa enhance the capacity for countering terrorism and maintaining stability, and contribute to the early realization of the “Silencing the Guns” initiative. China wishes to work with Africa to jointly implement the Global Security Initiative, and will increase its input to the UN Peace and Development Trust Fund and help improve the UN operations for stability and peace in Africa.Fourth, we need to deepen our friendship and forge a stronger bond between the peoples. China will overcome the difficulties caused by COVID-19 and actively facilitate the return of African students who wish to come back to China to resume their studies. We will also resume short-term in-person training programs in China in an orderly way, and steadily increase commercial flights to facilitate personnel interflow and business travels between our two sides. China is actively preparing for the China-Africa Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. We support think tanks, media organizations, people’s groups, the youth and women in enhancing exchange and cooperation to deepen friendship between the Chinese and African peoples.Fifth, we need to uphold openness and win-win results and promote the sound development of international cooperation with Africa. China welcomes continued interest in and support for Africa from the international community. We would also like to, with the consent of our African brothers, carry out trilateral or multi-party cooperation in Africa. What Africa wishes for is a favorable and amicable cooperation environment, not the zero-sum Cold War mentality. What Africa would welcome is mutually beneficial cooperation for the greater well-being of the people, not major-country rivalry for geopolitical gains.The FOCAC mechanism has traveled a journey of over two decades and has played a positive role in charting a right course for international cooperation with Africa. Under the new circumstances, China will continue to work with African friends to enhance the institution-building of FOCAC to jointly boost its well-established credentials. We will actively consider institutionalizing the coordinators’ meeting and work to mobilize more resources in favor of Africa. With our joint efforts, FOCAC will continue to be a standard-bearer of cooperation with Africa.Thank you.
                

                On 9 August 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu took questions from China Central Television and China Global Television Network on Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.Q1. Over the past few days, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has caused strong public outrage in China. What’s your take on this?Ma: This is just a political farce, and a dangerous, malicious provocation. Speaker Pelosi made this provocative visit in disregard of China’s warning. The visit infringed on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; violated the one-China principle and provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués; affected the political foundation of China-US relations; and undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is unacceptable to the Chinese people. China has every reason to respond with countermeasures. The incident is also a lesson, revealing to the world US motives to contain China with Taiwan and the intention of the Taiwan authorities to seek American support for independence. In its aftermath, the one-China consensus of the international community emerged stronger, and the US attempt to play the “Taiwan card” and contain China proved more unpopular and futile.Q2. The US claims that there is no change to its one-China policy and that Pelosi’s visit does not violate the one-China policy. How would you respond to that?Ma: The one-China principle is the consensus of the international community. It is also the political foundation on which China develops relations with other countries. It is a red line that must not be crossed. What does one China mean? There can only be one answer. That is, there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This is a basic norm of international relations confirmed by UNGA Resolution 2758. It is a commitment made by the US in the three China-US joint communiqués. The principle, written down in black and white, is crystal clear. There is no room for ambiguity or arbitrary interpretation.The US claims that there is no change in its one-China policy. But in fact, it has been undermining the one-China principle over the years. It has put into its one-China policy some unilateral stuff, including the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the “Six Assurances”. This is against international law. China never accepts it, and is always opposed to it.The US also claims that Pelosi’s visit does not violate the one-China policy. The three joint communiqués provide that the US can only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with Taiwan. The executive, legislative and judicial branches are all part of the US Government. Pelosi is the number three figure in the US Government. During her stay in Taiwan, she was speaking on behalf of the US from the beginning to the end. Even she herself admits that it is an official visit. If this is not official engagement, then what is it?Q3. The US claims that the change to the status quo that’s prevailed with regard to Taiwan for more than 40 years is coming from Beijing, not from the US. What is your view on this?Ma: So what is the status quo of the Taiwan Strait? The status quo is that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, Taiwan is part of China, and neither China’s sovereignty nor its territorial integrity is ever divided. It is not China who is changing the status quo, but the US and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. Over the years, the US has been colluding with the Taiwan authorities, and elevating its substantive relations with Taiwan. It has sold large amounts of weapons to Taiwan, helped it develop so-called “asymmetric capabilities”, and emboldened the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they?Refusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus, the DPP authorities have insisted on pushing for “incremental independence”, and redoubled efforts to remove the Chinese identity of Taiwan. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they? China’s countermeasures are a necessary and legitimate response to the provocations by the US and the “Taiwan independence” forces. They are just and lawful.Q4. The US says it will not seek and does not want a crisis, and China should take full responsibility for the current escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. What is your take on this?Ma: This is confounding black and white. The crisis is unilaterally provoked by the US. Despite China’s many representations, the US still allowed Pelosi to visit Taiwan. Faced with this, China has no choice but to fight back and defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The responsibility and consequence of the current tensions have to be borne by the US and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.Q5. The US claims that China’s military exercise and crossing of the median line of the Taiwan Strait are overreaction that has escalated the situation and threatened regional peace and stability. What is your take?Ma: It is the US that is threatening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is part of China’s territory. There is no such thing as a median line in the Strait. The Chinese armed forces conduct military exercises in waters off China’s Taiwan island to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. Our measures are open and proportionate. They are in line with both domestic law and international law and practices. They are beyond reproach.The US and its allies often come to the adjacent waters of China, flexing muscles and stirring up troubles. They conduct up to a hundred military exercises each year. They, instead of someone else, are the ones that overreact and escalate the situation.Q6. The US claims that China’s decision to suspend cooperation with the US in multiple areas does not punish Washington but the whole world. What is you comment?Ma: The US cannot represent the whole world. China has warned the US well in advance that should Pelosi visit Taiwan, it would cause a crisis and major disruptions to China-US exchange and cooperation. Unfortunately, the US side ignored that, and went ahead with the visit. The Taiwan question is at the very heart of China’s core interests. The United States, while undermining China’s core interests, is asking for China’s cooperation where they need it. What kind of logic is this? China’s decision to cancel or suspend cooperation in some areas does not come without warning. We say what we mean and mean what we say. There is no reason why the US should feel surprised or upset.Let me stress this: as a responsible major country, China will, as always, take an active part in international cooperation on climate change and other matters. We make our own contribution to the tackling of global challenges. What the US should do is to fulfill its international responsibilities and obligations. It should stop making excuses for its own mistakes. Q7. Some in the US compare China’s military drills in the Taiwan Strait to Russia’s “invasion of Ukraine”, which they claim will be denounced by the international community. What is your comment on that?Ma: Such a claim is ill-intentioned. The Taiwan question is entirely China’s internal affair. It is different from the Ukraine issue. The US always stokes tension and provokes troubles. Preliminary numbers show that between the end of the Second World War and 2001, there were 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions across the world, among which 201 were initiated by the US. Since 2001, wars and military operations launched by the US have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and tens of millions displaced from home. After starting so many wars and killing so many civilians to preserve its hegemony, the US is now creating troubles in the Taiwan Strait. How could we possibly allow this to happen?Q8. A few days ago, the G7 foreign ministers issued a statement regarding Taiwan with negative language, expressing so-called “concern” over China’s actions. Meanwhile we see an increasing number of countries and international organizations speaking out in support of China’s justified measures. What is your take?Ma: More than 170 countries and many international organizations have spoken up for what is right, reaffirming their commitment to the one-China principle and expressing support for China in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Both the President of the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General have stated that the UN will continue to adhere to UNGA Resolution 2758, the centerpiece of which is the one-China principle. Compared with over 170 countries, what do G7 think they are? Who cares what they say?Q9. The US claims that if China continues to take more countermeasures, the US will be forced to respond, which may lead to a spiral of escalation. What is your view on what may happen next?Ma: It has been proved time and again that the US is the biggest troublemaker of cross-Strait peace and regional stability. If the international community allows the US to do what it wants, the UN Charter will be just a sheet of paper, and the law of the jungle will prevail. In the end, it will be the developing countries that suffer.The Chinese people are not to be misled by fallacies or scared by evils, and will never waver in defending our core interests. We want to stress to the US: do not act recklessly, and stop going further down on the doomed path. Give up the attempt to use Taiwan to contain China, play no games but return to the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués, and do right things and take concrete steps to facilitate the steady development of China-US relations.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Ambassador Fu Cong,Head of the Chinese Delegation andDirector-General of the Department of Arms Control of The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China， At the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT(August 2nd , New York)Your Excellency President,Let me extend, on behalf of the Chinese Delegation, my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the Conference. Let me also extend my congratulations to the newly-elected Chairs of the three Main Committees. I assure you my delegation’s full support to your work.Having withstood the vicissitudes of the international landscape over the last 50-plus years, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has become the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and a vital component of the post-war international security system. Today, we live in a world where profound changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, both unseen in a century, are intertwined. The specter of Cold War mentality is there to stay, and the outdated approach to security based on military alliances has resurfaced. Driven by the obsession with so-called major-power strategic competition, the global strategic security environment continues to deteriorate, and risks of arms race and conflicts are growing. As a result, the international non-proliferation regime represented by the NPT is significantly strained and even faces new and the most severe challenges since the end of the Cold War. It is incumbent on all of us to take this Review Conference as an opportunity to uphold the authority and effectiveness of the NPT, promote the three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a balanced manner, in a bid to breathe new life into the NPT in promoting world peace and development. To this end, China proposes the following:First, we need to uphold the concept of common security in advancing international nuclear disarmament. China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and a nuclear strategy of self-defense, and undertakes not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. While firmly safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, China always keeps its nuclear capability at the minimum level required for safeguarding national security. We never compete with any country on the input, quantity or scale of its nuclear capability, nor do we participate in any form of nuclear arms race with any other country. With a high level of stability, consistency and predictability, China’s nuclear policy in itself is an important contribution to the international nuclear disarmament endeavor.The principles of “maintaining global strategic stability” and “undiminished security for all” should be followed in the practices of nuclear disarmament. The countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should further conduct significant and substantive reduction in their nuclear arsenals in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner. This will create conditions for other nuclear-weapon States to join the nuclear disarmament process.  Nuclear-weapon States need to work together to reduce nuclear risks. On January 3rd this year, the leaders of China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a Joint Statement, stressing that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, and reaffirming that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other State. This historic statement is helpful in enhancing mutual trust among major countries, preventing nuclear wars, and avoiding an arms race.On that basis, the five nuclear-weapon States need to further strengthen communication on strategic stability, and conduct in-depth dialogue on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their national security doctrines and on a broad range of issues, including missile defense, outer space, cyberspace, and artificial intelligence. Nuclear-weapon States should also strengthen dialogue with non-nuclear-weapon States to enhance mutual understanding and support.Second, we need to adhere to the direction of political settlement in addressing the challenges of nuclear-proliferation. All parties concerned should stay committed to bringing the JCPOA back on track at an early date through diplomatic negotiations, and reject the practices of pressuring with sanctions and threat of force. The U.S. should completely lift its relevant illegal sanctions on Iran and long-arm jurisdiction measures on third parties. On that basis, Iran should return to full compliance with its nuclear commitments.The international community should reject double standards in the area of non-proliferation. The nuclear-powered submarine cooperation among the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia poses severe nuclear proliferation risks, in contravention of the object and purpose of the NPT. The review conference should conduct in-depth discussions on its implications in all aspects, including its challenges to the IAEA safeguards system, in order to  firmly uphold the international non-proliferation regime.The security situation on the Korean Peninsula remains complex and severe. We need to follow the dual track approach and the principle of phased and synchronized actions in advancing the process towards the establishment of a peace mechanism and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.The so-called nuclear sharing arrangements run counter to the provisions of the NPT and increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and nuclear conflicts. The United States should withdraw all its nuclear weapons from Europe and refrain from deploying nuclear weapons in any other region. The relevant non-nuclear-weapon States should earnestly fulfill their NPT obligations and their own commitments, stop instigating nuclear sharing or other forms of nuclear deterrence arrangements. Any attempt to replicate the NATO’s nuclear sharing model in the Asia-Pacific region would undermine regional strategic stability and would be firmly opposed by the countries in the region and, when necessary, face severe countermeasures.  The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is conducive to attaining the goal of nuclear non-proliferation. The international community should make every endeavor to support the establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction. Nuclear-weapon States should sign and ratify all the relevant protocols to the nuclear-weapons-free zone treaties as early as possible, including the Central Asia Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons. China is willing to take the lead in signing the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone.Third, we need to commit to the fundamental goal of common development and promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The international community should support the IAEA in playing a central role, increase funding and technological support for developing countries, fully unleash the potential of nuclear energy and nuclear technology in addressing climate change and promoting green development, and contribute to faster implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. All parties should take this Review Conference as an opportunity to jointly map out a new blueprint for promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  We must take a balanced approach towards non-proliferation and peaceful uses. Some countries seek to create divisions along ideological lines, stretch the concept of national security, abuse multilateral export control regime, and even attempt to create a new version of the Coordinating Committee for Export to Communist Countries, all in the name of non-proliferation. We must resolutely reject such practices, which go against the trend of the times, disrupt normal international cooperation, and harm the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries. Nuclear safety and security is the lifeline of nuclear energy development and nuclear technology application. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy should not come at the expense of the natural environment and human health. Japan should seriously respond to the legitimate concerns of its neighbouring countries and the international community at large regarding the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, fully consult with the stakeholders and the relevant international agencies, in order to find an appropriate solution to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Mr. President,We humanity are living in an indivisible security community. Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework. Hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace. And bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century. This April, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed a Global Security Initiative at the opening ceremony of the Annual Conference of the Boao Forum for Asia. This initiative highlights the necessity to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, to giving due regard to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, to upholding the principle of indivisible security and building a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. Guided by this initiative,China is ready to join hands with all countries to continuously strengthen the universality, authority and effectiveness of the NPT, to inject stability and certainty into this era of turbulence and transformation, and make new contribution to world peace, stability and prosperity. To conclude, I wish this conference a great success.Thank you, Mr. President.
                

                Remarks by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang YiAt the Opening Ceremony ofThe Workshop on Commemoration of the 20th Anniversary ofThe Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China SeaDistinguished guests,Dear friends old and new,It gives me great pleasure to meet you virtually to jointly celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). On 4 November 2002, government representatives of China and ASEAN countries solemnly signed the DOC in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Today, we are gathered here to relive the DOC spirit, revisit the journey leading to it, and envision future cooperation on the governance of the South China Sea. This is indeed very important.As the first political document signed by China and ASEAN countries on the South China Sea, the DOC has established the basic principles and common norms for the parties to handle the relevant issue. Acting in compliance with the DOC over the past two decades, we have jointly maintained peace and stability and ensured freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea. Over the past two decades, the DOC has been a platform for our active maritime dialogue and cooperation, leading to early harvests in many fields. Over the past two decades, the DOC has also been a framework enabling us to consolidate political mutual trust and build vibrant relations. The successful signing and implementation of the DOC gives us important inspirations.First, peace and stability in the South China Sea is an important precondition for regional development. Stability in the South China Sea benefits regional countries, while instability incurs misfortune. The China-ASEAN relationship always improves and grows along with the joint efforts of maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, and they always reinforce each other. Bearing in mind their overall interests, China and ASEAN countries have exercised restraint, kept their differences and disputes in a proper place, and got them on the track of consultation and management as prescribed by the DOC. This has created a favorable environment and important underpinning for the development and prosperity of the countries and the well-being of the peoples in the region.Second, countries in the region are the ones who have the final say on properly handling the South China Sea issue. Taking the South China Sea as our common home, China and ASEAN countries have creatively proposed and advanced a dual-track approach. That is, countries concerned seek to settle their maritime disputes through friendly consultations and negotiations, and China and ASEAN countries jointly uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea. Practices have proved that the dual-track approach, which fits in well with regional reality and carries distinctive regional features, has not only been effective in managing the maritime situation and maintaining overall stability in the South China Sea, but has also laid a sound foundation for the joint protection, development and exploitation of the South China Sea.Third, the East Asian way is an effective means to build and uphold consensus. The DOC captures the essence of the East Asian culture, such as seeking consensus and accommodating the comfort level of all parties. It also reflects the maximum common understanding of regional countries on the South China Sea issue. In implementing the DOC, we always follow the Asian tradition of respecting each other and honoring our words. We reject zero-sum games, and advocate the positive-sum approach of win-win cooperation. All this has demonstrated the precious value and great vitality of the DOC.Distinguished Guests,The world today is in a new period of turbulence and transformation. And the South China Sea is not tranquil, either. In an attempt to preserve their hegemony, certain countries outside the region keep intensifying their power projection in this region, and deliberately seek to widen differences and provoke tensions, undermining the legitimate rights and interests of coastal countries and the normal order at sea. In face of this, China and ASEAN countries need to make our position clear: we welcome those who come here for peace and cooperation, but we ask those to leave who come here to make troubles.As ancient Chinese wisdom cautions, one must constantly improve himself and keep abreast with the times. Two decades ago, we seized the historical opportunity and started dialogue and cooperation on the South China Sea issue. Today, in the new historical context, we must stay true to our original aspiration. We must continue to firmly uphold the purposes and principles of the DOC, unswervingly observe the norms and propositions laid out therein, and keep the initiative of resolving the South China Sea issue in the hands of regional countries. We must work together to truly build the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.We should continue to hold the bottom line of peace. The South China Sea is not a “hunting ground” for countries outside the region, still less should it be a “wrestling ground” for big powers. We should staunchly support all efforts that are conducive to peaceful settlement and management of disputes, and unequivocally reject words and actions that aim to stoke tension and confrontation in the region. We should stand on the side of people’s desire for peace and the trend of the times.We should continue to promote dialogue and consultation. Dialogue and consultation provides the fundamental pathway to resolving differences, and it is the essence of the DOC. We need to continuously refine bilateral and multilateral mechanisms for dialogue on maritime issues, and enhance mutual trust and security through communication and consultation. We should find a way of governance of the South China Sea that takes into account the demands and interests of all relevant parties, and make joint efforts toward durable peace and security in the South China Sea.We should continue to deepen maritime cooperation. The South China Sea is a treasure shared by all countries in the region. It is important for us to protect it well and better harness its resources. We need to make bold explorations with an open mind, gradually establish and improve mechanisms for cooperation among the coastal countries, actively promote practical cooperation in such areas as scientific research, environmental protection, search and rescue, and explore the possibility of joint resource development, in order to deliver greater benefits to the countries and peoples of the region.We should continue to advance COC negotiations. Adopting a code of conduct in the South China Sea is an express requirement of the DOC and an imperative given the evolving situation. We should follow the spirit of the DOC, expedite our efforts toward an enhanced and upgraded version of the DOC, and strive to reach at an early date an effective and substantive COC that is consistent with international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in order to provide stronger institutional safeguards for managing differences and advancing cooperation.Distinguished Guests,In recent years, President Xi Jinping has put forth the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. Responding to the trend of the times and focusing on peace and development, these two important Initiatives have pointed the direction for our endeavor to better maintain peace in the South China Sea and promote development. With China being a major maritime country, neither its present nor its future can disassociate from the ocean, including the South China Sea. China will continue to follow the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in its neighborhood diplomacy, and work together with ASEAN countries to be a defender of maritime peace, builder of maritime order, advocate of maritime cooperation, and contributor to maritime development. I am convinced that with the tireless efforts of China and ASEAN countries, peace and stability in the South China Sea will be better preserved, and the positive momentum of maritime dialogue and cooperation will be sustained. The South China Sea and our region will enjoy a better and brighter future.I hope that the participants will make the most of this workshop to engage in full discussion and contribute ideas and insights to the governance of the South China Sea and regional stability.In closing, I wish the Workshop a full success.Thank you!
                

                Speech by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang YiAt the ASEAN SecretariatJakarta, 11 July 2022Your Excellency Dato Lim Jock Hoi, Secretary-General of ASEAN,Permanent Representatives of ASEAN Member States,Fellow Diplomats and Friends,I am delighted to join so many friends, both old and new, at the ASEAN Secretariat in renewing our friendship and advancing cooperation through the “Jakarta Channel”. Let me begin by conveying, on behalf of the Chinese government, our warm congratulations on the 55th birthday of ASEAN and a big thank-you to all the friends for your interest in and support for China-ASEAN cooperation.China and ASEAN are linked by mountains and waters as well as hearts and aspirations. We are always good neighbors, good friends and good partners with a shared future. I have been personally engaging with ASEAN for more than three decades. In recent years, I have visited ASEAN countries almost every year and met with ASEAN foreign ministers frequently. Through my travels and engagements, I am keenly aware of the rapid and phenomenal development of China-ASEAN relations. Over the past 10 years in particular, thanks to the strategic guidance and personal commitment of President Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN countries, China-ASEAN relations have entered the “fast lane” and made accelerating progress.In retrospect, the most encouraging development was that China-ASEAN relations have stayed ahead in many areas. China was the first to forge a strategic partnership with ASEAN, the first to join the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, the first to start FTA negotiation with ASEAN, the first to give unequivocal support for ASEAN centrality in regional cooperation, and the first to publicly express its willingness to sign the Protocol to the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone. My ASEAN colleagues have told me that among ASEAN’s dialogue partners, China has the most vibrant and productive ties with ASEAN.The most touching event was China and ASEAN countries have been standing together in solidarity to fight COVID-19. When China was hit first by the virus, ASEAN countries immediately expressed solidarity and support and donated in cash and in kind to tide us over the trying time. When ASEAN countries were affected by the pandemic, China did its best to help ASEAN brothers fend off the virus, including sharing COVID response experience without reservation and providing timely vaccine assistance. Our cooperation against COVID-19 was a vivid testament to our deep friendship through thick and thin. Together, we have set a good example of working together to beat the virus.The most heartening progress was the thriving economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN. We are each other’s largest trading partner. Our trade volume has soared 100 times from 30 years before. Our two-way direct investment has exceeded US$310 billion. The China-Laos railway is up and running. Good progress has been made in the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, the China-Thailand railway, the China-Malaysia and China-Indonesia “twin industrial parks”, and a number of other Belt and Road projects.The most gratifying achievement was that China-ASEAN security cooperation has been making steady progress. With full implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and positive progress in the consultations of a code of conduct in the South China Sea (COC), differences and disputes are being effectively managed. The situation on the sea has remained stable on the whole, and there has been no problem with the freedom of navigation and overflight. Military and security exchanges have deepened, and fruitful cooperation has been carried out in non-traditional security areas such as counter-terrorism, climate response, cybersecurity, combating transnational crime, and disaster preparedness and reduction.In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations, President Xi Jinping made five proposals on building our home together, and announced together with ASEAN leaders the establishment of a China-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, pointing the way forward for the growth of China-ASEAN relations. With this year being the first year for building the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership, we should get off to a good start, make solid steps, and lead the way forward. We should get united, and join hands together to keep China-ASEAN cooperation at the forefront of the times and galvanize stronger force for peace and progress.Friends,This year marks the 55th anniversary of ASEAN. Over the past 55 years, ASEAN has embarked on an extraordinary development path from early inception to steady growth in size and strength. Meanwhile, the past 55 years was also a golden era of Asia’s rise and take-off.With concerted efforts of all countries in the region, Asia has become a highland of development and promising land for cooperation. Recently, the Boao Forum for Asia published the Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report, which pointed out that in 2021, Asia was the first to recover amid the global pandemic, and that Asia became an important engine for global economic growth. Early this year, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, the world’s largest free trade area, officially went into effect, injecting strong impetus to regional development.With concerted efforts of all countries in the region, Asia is also becoming a fine example of global governance. Most notably, a number of key multilateral events will be held in Asia this year. China has successfully hosted the BRICS Summit, and Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand will host the leaders’ meetings on East Asia cooperation, the G20 Summit, and the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting respectively. The world’s attention is turning to the Asian region, global governance has ushered in the moment of Asia, and the international community needs to listen attentively to the voice of Asia.Our region has secured such remarkable achievements in development and created exceptional miracles in growth, most fundamentally because countries in the region have adhered to open regionalism, respected and appreciated the diversities among members, and upheld and practiced the principle of voluntarism. We have advanced regional economic integration through free trade, promoted regional and sub-regional cooperation via equal consultation, and developed networks of friends worldwide with an open mindset. Asia is standing at a new historical starting point and facing unprecedented development opportunities. But we must also be aware that the world today is not peaceful, and there are two completely different trends concerning the future of Asia. One advocates open regionalism, true multilateralism, a development-first approach and mutually beneficial cooperation; it aims to help countries in the region emerge from the pandemic and achieve all-round development as soon as possible. The other pursues a relapse into the obsolete Cold War mentality and closed group politics, and classifies countries in the region based on their values; it attempts to divide the regional economy into different blocs and even apply the NATO approach to Asia-Pacific security.The choice we make today determines where the path will take us from now on — openness or isolation, cooperation or confrontation, solidarity or division, progress or regression. It will have a fundamental and far-reaching impact on the future of all countries in the region.As a Chinese saying goes, “Advancing with the times opens up new horizons.” Both history and reality show that a country, or a region for that matter, can only make progress when it follows the trend of the times. President Xi Jinping has pointed out on multiple occasions that openness is the lifeline of Asia-Pacific cooperation and that we need to uphold open regionalism. Therefore, China chooses to join hands with ASEAN members and other regional countries to adhere to the vision of peace, development, independence and inclusiveness, firmly uphold open regionalism and, by drawing experience and wisdom from Asian civilizations and practices, constantly add new dimensions to open regionalism.We need to always uphold the concept of peaceful coexistence. In history, China lived in harmony with Southeast Asian countries and other neighbors, leaving touching stories of good neighborliness and enduring friendship. In the 1950s, we together advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, under which all countries enjoy rights to peace regardless of their size and strength. Over the past half century, the region has developed the ASEAN way, namely, the Asian way, underpinned by major principles such as mutual respect, consensus-building, and accommodating the comfort levels of all parties. It has established a diversified and multi-layered security architecture, and fostered a proactive thinking of pursuing common, cooperative and comprehensive security. All this has laid a solid foundation for lasting peace in Asia.At present, frequent international security crises are sounding the alarm for mankind. It is a stark reminder that peace should never be taken for granted and must be carefully preserved and cherished. We should never allow any attempt to extend geopolitical conflicts or bloc confrontation to Asia, nor do we want to see any sanction, blockade or humanitarian crisis in this part of the world. Not long ago, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Security Initiative (GSI), offering China’s solution to global peace deficit and global security dilemma. It is necessary that we unequivocally champion the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We need to stay committed to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, taking seriously the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and resolving differences and disputes in a peaceful way through dialogue and consultation, in a bid to protect our shared home and defend our fundamental interest in peace and stability.We need to always uphold the goal of development and rejuvenation. For a long period of time in history, the Asian economy accounted for over half of the world’s total. In modern times however, its development stagnated and fell behind. Today, the valve to Asia’s development and progress is fully open, unleashing a strong momentum of rejuvenation and prosperity in the region. In only one generation’s time, Asia doubled its share of global GDP and transformed itself from a low-income region to a middle-income one. Asia’s development is attributed to the hard work of people of all Asian countries. We never committed colonial plunder or moved the “cheese” of any country outside the region, still less trying to replace or drive away anyone. All we want is to bring a better life to our peoples.At present, the Asian economy is facing growing risks, with disruptions to the stability of regional industrial and supply chains and unabated noises of “decoupling” and “severing supply chains”. The Global Development Initiative (GDI) put forth by President Xi Jinping has pooled consensus and strength for the collective efforts of the international community to meet challenges, drive global economic recovery and accelerate the implementation of UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is necessary that we continue to be development-oriented, form a right perception of each other’s development and share development opportunities. We should together defend the multilateral trading regime with the WTO as the cornerstone, ensure a free and open global market, and promote integrated economic development.We need to always uphold the principle of independence. In modern times, regional countries including China and ASEAN members had suffered from colonization and aggression. We achieved national independence and liberation after tenacious struggles. We value the hard-won independence like our life. We hope that we can independently choose political systems and development paths, independently pursue foreign and defense policies, and independently decide on the pathway and pace in participating in economic globalization and advancing regional integration. ASEAN countries have initiated and led Asia’s regional cooperation mechanisms. Their independence and centrality has been widely respected by countries within and outside the region.At present, many countries in the region, including ASEAN countries, are under the pressure to take sides, and the strategic environment in the region risks being reshaped by political factors. It is necessary that we continue to uphold independence, respect each other’s sovereignty and core interests, and respect the integrity, independence and leading role of ASEAN as a community. We should insulate this region from geopolitical calculations and the trap of the law of the jungle, from being used as chess pieces in major-power rivalry, and from coercion by hegemony and bullying. Our future, and the future of our region, should be in our own hands.We need to always uphold the spirit of openness and inclusiveness. Openness and inclusiveness are inherent in the genes of regional civilizations; they are also the keys to the regional economic miracle. More than 60 years ago at the Bandung Conference,countries in this region made a just call for seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing peaceful coexistence. Since the end of the Cold War, as pioneers in globalization and pace-setters of free trade, countries in this region have embraced the world with greater openness, supported each other with an inclusive spirit, and ensured together the economic takeoff of Asia.At present, despite current headwinds, globalization keeps surging forward as it is still the prevailing trend. Seclusion and isolation will only lead to rigidity and backwardness, while inclusiveness and openness will bring mutual benefit and win-win results. It is necessary that we promote harmony without uniformity, embrace diversity in coexistence, and reject the attempt to split the region into confrontational or exclusive groups. We should uphold true regional cooperation that unites countries within the region and remains open to countries outside, and reject the kind of fake regional cooperation that keeps certain country out and targets certain side. We believe that the Asia-Pacific is big enough for all regional countries to pursue their development and at the same time promote common development, and that all can prosper respectively and collectively.Friends,As the world’s largest developing country and an important member in Asia, China has always followed a path of peaceful development and a win-win strategy of opening-up. We pursue friendship and partnership with our neighbors, seek an amicable, secure and prosperous neighborhood, and follow a neighborhood policy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. We hope to champion open regionalism together with ASEAN and deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership.  China will continue to support ASEAN Centrality and promote solidarity and cooperation in the region. ASEAN is at the center of all ASEAN Plus “concentric circles” of regional cooperation. China firmly supports ASEAN’s role in the “driver’s seat”, supports ASEAN community-building, and supports the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture. China welcomes ASEAN’s efforts to formulate a Post-2025 Vision for the ASEAN Community. We are ready to assist ASEAN countries in achieving their development goals by tapping into such resources as the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and the China-ASEAN Cooperation Fund. We will also scale up input into the Initiative for ASEAN Integration, Lancang-Mekong cooperation and BIMP-EAGA, to help close the development gap in the region.ASEAN has stressed on many occasions that its Outlook on the Indo-Pacific is an independent initiative that commits to openness and inclusiveness and focuses on dialogue, cooperation and economic development, and that it is not subservient to or targeted against any party. China appreciates this position. We would like to increase synergy and cooperation with ASEAN on the implementation of the Outlook to produce cooperation outcomes at an early date.China will continue to call for settling differences in the Asian way and uphold regional peace and stability. We will work with other countries in the region to implement the Global Security Initiative, and deepen cooperation in such areas as defense, counterterrorism, joint maritime search and rescue and exercise, combating transnational crimes, and disaster management. We hope to blaze a new path of security that chooses dialogue over confrontation, partnerships over alliances, and win-win over zero-sum game, and put into practice principles for how neighbors may get along: trust as the basis, the greater good as priority, and sincerity in interaction.China and ASEAN countries are expediting the COC consultations, which will serve as solid institutional safeguards for more effective management of differences in the South China Sea, more vigorous advancement of cooperation and more active joint governance. We will continue to support ASEAN’s efforts in building a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and reaffirm that China is ready to sign the protocol to the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone at any time.China will continue to pursue firmly its open strategy for development and promote regional economic integration. We will speed up the importing of US$150 billion worth of ASEAN agricultural goods, bring in more high-quality products from ASEAN countries, and encourage more Chinese companies to make ASEAN their top investment destination. We will continue to promote post-COVID recovery, advance the development of demonstration zones for Belt and Road international industrial capacity cooperation, enhance the resilience of industrial and supply chains in the region, and ensure smooth trade flows across borders.We are ready to launch a new round of upgrade of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area as soon as possible, and implement the RCEP across the board and promote its upgrade in due course. China remains firm in its resolve to join the CPTPP and DEPA, and is ready to sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries. China looks forward to closely integrating the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and China-ASEAN cooperation, and supports Hong Kong and Macao in engaging in more extensive and closer exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN countries.China will continue to resolutely advance cooperation in science, technology and innovation to stimulate new drivers of development in the region. China and ASEAN have formulated the Action Plan for Implementing the China-ASEAN Partnership on Digital Economy Cooperation (2021-2025). China will earnestly implement this plan of action with a focus on increasing input in digital infrastructure and digital transformation in this region, deepening practical cooperation in e-commerce, actively facilitating dialogue on digital governance and coordination and harmonization of rules in the digital arena, and strengthening digital connectivity.We are ready to, through the Belt and Road partnership on green development and the Bio-Circular-Green Economy (BCG) model, explore cooperation on low-carbon, circular and green economy, and jointly build platforms for cooperation in clean energy science and technology. We will advance barrier- and discrimination-free scientific and technological innovation that transcends borders. We will implement well the China-ASEAN Science, Technology and Innovation Enhancing Program, and speed up talent cultivation and technology transfer, to provide a constant source of strength for high-quality economic growth, and accelerate regional transformation and development.China will continue to carry forward Asian values and deepen the bonds of friendship among peoples in the region. The older generation of leaders of ASEAN countries insightfully summarized Asian values as cherishing family, community, consensus and morality. China feels the same way. We are ready to work with ASEAN to carry forward and practice Asian values, rise above the zero-sum mentality, and deepen our brotherly bond of sharing weal and woe in the spirit of solidarity and partnership. China will adopt more measures to facilitate the flow of people and discuss the launch of tourism recovery plans with all sides at the proper time. We support the development of an ASEAN travel corridor. In a post-COVID era, we will proactively step up exchanges in culture and between the youth, subnational entities, media and women, to promote mutual understanding, amity and affinity between our peoples.Friends,ASEAN’s motto, “One Vision, One Identity, One Community”, is also a portrayal of the region’s spirit of seeking strength through unity. In the new era, China is ready to work with ASEAN member states and other countries in the region to uphold peace, independence, development and inclusiveness, and resolutely practice open regionalism. Together, we will build a common homeland that enjoys peace, tranquility, prosperity, beautiful environment and friendship, and write a new chapter of regional cooperation and Asian vitalization!Thank you.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister ofThe People’s Republic of ChinaAt Session 1 — Strengthening Multilateralism ofThe G20 Foreign Ministers’ MeetingBali, 8 July 2022Your Excellency Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi,Colleagues,It is such a pleasure to attend this G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. I thank Foreign Minister Marsudi and the Indonesian government for the thoughtful arrangements made for the Chinese delegation.As we meet, the world is struggling against the protracted pandemic, an unstable security landscape, and downward pressure on the economy. World peace and development is confronted with major challenges. The international community is looking to the G20 to build global consensus and promote international cooperation, and give confidence and hope to a world of uncertainties.The G20 originated from the international cooperation in response to the global financial crisis. The declaration of the first summit clearly states that “we are confident that through continued partnership, cooperation, and multilateralism, we will overcome the challenges before us.” Given the current circumstances, it is imperative that we revisit this original purpose and work as cooperation partners for true multilateralism.— We should be partners of mutual respect and equal consultation. International affairs should be handled by all countries through consultation, and international rules jointly formulated and observed by all countries. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e., the international system with the United Nations at its core. There is only one international order, i.e., the international order underpinned by international law. Imposing the rules made by a certain country or group on others is the antithesis of multilateralism.— We should be partners of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. One can only ensure its own security when it takes others’ security seriously and upholds the security of all. Attempts by a certain country to put its own security above that of others, strengthen military blocs, create an ideological iron curtain, or even threaten to shape others’ surrounding environment by one’s own standards will only cause conflict and confrontation and split the international community. They would only make one even less safe.— We should be partners of openness, inclusiveness and connectivity. While it is alright for countries to have fair competition with each other, they should not engage in vicious competition or even malicious confrontation. Beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies, building a small yard with high fences, and forming closed and exclusionary small circles all run counter to the trend of the times. Those who attempt to isolate others will end up isolating themselves.Colleagues,As an Indonesian proverb says, “Heavy we shoulder together, light we carry together”. China hopes to work with all other G20 members to overcome differences with solidarity, replace confrontation with cooperation, and translate the spirit of multilateralism into concrete actions for safeguarding world peace and promoting common development.— We hope to work with all sides to facilitate talks, and we always stand firmly on the side of peace. Russia and Ukraine are both friends of China. We hope the two sides will realize peace through dialogue and consultation.The pressing priority is to achieve an earlier ceasefire, ease the humanitarian crisis and prevent the conflict from dragging on and expanding. China has provided Ukraine with two batches of humanitarian assistance worth of 15 million yuan. And we soon will provide another 20 million yuan of emergency humanitarian supplies.NATO and the EU should conduct serious and comprehensive dialogue with Russia and work together for a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for Europe. Limitless unilateral sanctions are unsustainable, and attempts to heighten tensions and stoke confrontation are not helpful for peace talks.— We hope to work with all parties on macro economic policy coordination to promote inclusive recovery and growth of the world economy, and realize the vision of “Recover Together, Recover Stronger” set by this year’s G20 President.To this end, we should act to keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and ease the global inflationary pressures.We should act on the consensus of WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference, strengthen the multilateral trading system, and foster an open, transparent and non-discriminatory international trading environment.More importantly, economies who are issuers of major reserve currencies should take their due responsibilities to prevent negative spillovers of their monetary policy adjustments.We should also keep development a priority of G20 cooperation, and step up collaboration in such areas as poverty reduction, COVID-19, infrastructure, and green development.China recently hosted the BRICS Summit and the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, which produced broad consensus on supporting multilateralism and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Committed to the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, we will actively follow upon the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI) put forth by President Xi Jinping, strongly support Indonesia’s G20 Presidency, and work with all parties for a world of peace, development and win-win cooperation.Thank you.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the High-level Dialogue on Global Development 24 June 2022Dear Colleagues:Development is a timeless theme for humanity. In the late 1960s, I worked as a farmer in a small village on the Loess Plateau. There I experienced first-hand the hardships in farming and saw how the local people struggled to make ends meet. Their longing for a better life has stayed in my mind ever since. Half a century later, I revisited the village and found the villagers no longer in want of food or clothing, as evidenced by the happy smiles on their faces.  As an ancient Chinese saying goes, “Only when the granary is full will people learn etiquette; only when people are well-fed and clothed will they know honor and shame.” Throughout the years, I have been to cities, towns and villages across China and visited many countries in the world. One deep impression I get is that only through continuous development can the people’s dream for a better life and social stability be realized.    Over the years, developing countries have worked unremittingly to explore development paths suited to their national realities and to pursue economic and social development. Such efforts have produced remarkable outcomes. Today, emerging markets and developing countries account for half of the world economy, and notable progress has been made in science and technology, education, social development, culture and many other areas.We are meeting at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is eroding decades of gains in global development, the implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is encountering difficulties, the North-South gap keeps widening, and crises are emerging in food and energy security. Some countries have politicized and marginalized the development issue, built “a small yard with high fences”, imposed maximum sanctions, and stoked division and confrontation. At the same time, people in all countries are more keen about pursuing peace, development and cooperation, emerging markets and developing countries are more resolved to seek strength through unity, and the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation is bringing more opportunities to countries around the world.This is an age rife with challenges, but it is also an age full of hope. We must get a good grasp of the overarching development trend in the world, firm up confidence, and act in unison and with great motivation to promote global development and foster a development paradigm featuring benefits for all, balance, coordination, inclusiveness, win-win cooperation and common prosperity.First, we need to jointly build international consensus on promoting development. Only when people all over the world live better lives can prosperity be sustained, security safeguarded and human rights solidly grounded. It is important that we put development front and center on the international agenda, deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build political consensus to ensure everyone values development and all countries pursue cooperation together.Second, we need to jointly create an enabling international environment for development. Protectionist moves will boomerang; anyone attempting to form exclusive blocs will end up isolating himself; maximum sanctions serve nobody’s interest, and practices of decoupling and supply disruption are neither feasible nor sustainable. It is important that we pursue development in real earnest and promote development in concert, build an open world economy, and shape a global governance system and institutional environment that are more just and equitable.Third, we need to jointly foster new drivers for global development. Innovation is the primary driving force for development. It is important that we promote scientific, technological and institutional innovation, speed up technology transfer and knowledge sharing, boost the development of modern industries, close the digital divide and accelerate low-carbon transition, with a view to achieving stronger, greener and healthier global development.Fourth, we need to jointly forge a global development partnership. Only by working together can we accomplish big and great things with a far-reaching impact. Developed countries need to fulfill obligations, developing countries need to deepen cooperation, and the North and the South need to work in the same direction to forge a united, equal, balanced and inclusive global development partnership. In this process, no country or individual should be left behind. It is important that we support the UN in steering and coordinating global development cooperation, and encourage business communities, social groups, the media and think tanks to take part in such cooperation. Colleagues,China has always been a member of the big family of developing countries. At last year’s UN General Assembly session, I put forth the Global Development Initiative (GDI). China will take pragmatic steps to give continued support to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.— China will allocate more resources for global development cooperation. We will upgrade the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund to a Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, and add US$1 billion to the fund on top of the US$3 billion already committed. We will also increase input to the UN Peace and Development Trust Fund. Such efforts will further support cooperation under the GDI.— China will work with all sides to advance cooperation in priority areas and mobilize resources for development to deepen global cooperation on poverty reduction and eradication, build capacity for food production and supply, and promote clean energy partnerships; step up innovation, research and development and joint production of vaccines; work on the conservation and sustainable use of land and marine ecology; and raise digital literacy and skills of the public, transform and upgrade the path to industrialization at a faster pace, and enhance digital-era connectivity to inject new impetus into the development of all countries.— China will set up a platform for experience and knowledge sharing on international development, a global development promotion center and a global knowledge network for development, for the purpose of exchanging governance experience and promoting mutual learning. We will host a global forum on youth development and take part in the launch of a global action plan on youth development, in a bid to pool as much strength as possible for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As an ancient Chinese adage goes, “With one heart and one mind, we can accomplish everything we aspire for.” Let us firm up confidence, stride forward in pursuit of high-quality partnership, and usher in a new era of prosperity and development.Thank you.
                

                Remarks by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 14th BRICS Summit23 June 2022Dear Colleagues,Our world today is living through accelerating changes unseen in a century and continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. They confront humanity with unprecedented challenges and usher in a new phase of instability and transformation for global development.The Chinese people often say, “True gold can stand the test of fire.” Over the past 16 years, the giant ship of BRICS has sailed forward tenaciously against raging torrents and storms. Riding the wind and cleaving the waves, it has embarked on a righteous course of mutual support and win-win cooperation. Standing at the crossroads of history, we should both look back at the journey we have traveled and keep in mind why we established BRICS in the first place, and look forward to a shared future of a more comprehensive, close, practical and inclusive high-quality partnership so as to jointly embark on a new journey of BRICS cooperation.First, we need to uphold solidarity and safeguard world peace and tranquility. Our world today is overshadowed by the dark clouds of Cold War mentality and power politics, and beset by constantly emerging traditional and non-traditional security threats. Some countries attempt to expand military alliances to seek absolute security, stoke bloc-based confrontation by coercing other countries into picking sides, and pursue unilateral dominance at the expense of others’ rights and interests. If such dangerous trends are allowed to continue, the world will witness even more turbulence and insecurity.It is important that BRICS countries support each other on issues concerning core interests, practice true multilateralism, safeguard justice, fairness and solidarity and reject hegemony, bullying and division. This year, we have held the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and the Meeting of High Representatives on National Security, deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and other issues, enhanced coordination at the United Nations and other multilateral institutions, and spoke out for justice on the international stage.Not long ago, I put forward the Global Security Initiative (GSI), which advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, follows the philosophy that humanity is an indivisible security community, and aims to create a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance and win-win over zero-sum. China would like to work with BRICS partners to operationalize the GSI and bring more stability and positive energy to the world.Second, we need to uphold cooperation to boost development and jointly tackle risks and challenges. The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis has resulted in disruptions to global industrial and supply chains, sustained hikes of commodity prices, and weaker international monetary and financial systems. All these have cast shadows over development worldwide, and emerging markets and developing countries bear the brunt. But just as a crisis may bring chaos, it can also spur change. A lot will ride on how we handle the crisis. This year, we launched the BRICS Initiative on Enhancing Cooperation on Supply Chains and the Initiative on Trade and Investment for Sustainable Development, adopted the Agreement on Cooperation and Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters and the Strategy on Food Security Cooperation, and held a High-level Meeting on Climate Change for the first time. We should make good use of these new platforms to boost connectivity of industrial and supply chains and jointly meet challenges in poverty reduction, agriculture, energy, logistics and other fields. We should support greater development of the New Development Bank and a steady process to admit new members, and improve the Contingent Reserve Arrangement to cement the BRICS financial safety net and firewall. We should also expand BRICS cooperation on cross-border payment and credit rating to facilitate trade, investment and financing among our countries.Last year, I put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI), which aims to re-energize the implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and build a global community of development. China stands ready to work with BRICS partners to add more substance to the GDI and contribute to stronger, greener and healthier global development.Third, we need to uphold the pioneering spirit and innovation and unleash the potential and vitality of cooperation. Those who seize the opportunities of the new economy, such as big data and artificial intelligence, are in sync with the pulse of the times. Those who seek to create monopoly, blockade and barriers in science and technology in order to disrupt other countries’ innovation and development and hold on to their dominant position are doomed to fail.We need to improve global science and technology governance and allow more people to access and benefit from the fruits of scientific and technological advances. This year, we have accelerated the building of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution Innovation Center in Xiamen, hosted the Forum on the Development of Industrial Internet and Digital Manufacturing and the Forum on Big Data for Sustainable Development, reached the Digital Economy Partnership Framework, issued the Initiative for Cooperation on Digitalization of Manufacturing, and established a network of technology transfer centers and an aerospace cooperation mechanism. All these have opened new channels for closer industrial policy coordination between BRICS countries. Recognizing the importance of talents in the digital age, we have set up the Alliance for Vocational Education, and organized the Skills Competition and the Women Innovation Contest to build a talent pool for stronger BRICS cooperation on innovation and entrepreneurship.Fourth, we need to uphold openness and inclusiveness and pool collective wisdom and strength. BRICS countries gather not in a closed club or an exclusive circle, but a big family of mutual support and a partnership for win-win cooperation. At the Xiamen Summit in 2017, I proposed the “BRICS Plus” cooperation approach. Over the past five years, “BRICS Plus” cooperation has deepened and expanded, setting a prime example of South-South cooperation and seeking strength through unity among emerging markets and developing countries.Under the new circumstances, it is all the more important for BRICS countries to pursue development with open doors and boost cooperation with open arms. This year we, for the first time, invited guest countries to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The newly established BRICS Vaccine R&D Center has an unequivocal commitment to openness. Step by step, we have organized a variety of “BRICS Plus” events in such areas as scientific and technological innovation, people-to-people exchanges and sustainable development. All these provide new platforms for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries.In recent years, many countries have asked to join the BRICS cooperation mechanism. Bringing in fresh blood will inject new vitality into BRICS cooperation and increase the representativeness and influence of BRICS. This year we have, on separate occasions, had in-depth discussions on the question of membership expansion. It is important to advance this process to allow like-minded partners to become part of the BRICS family at an early date.Colleagues,As representatives of emerging markets and developing countries, we must make the right decision and take responsible actions at this critical juncture of history. What we do will have a significant impact on the world. Let us stay united, pool strength and forge ahead to build a community with a shared future for mankind and jointly create a bright future for humanity.Thank you.
                

                Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the Opening Ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum22 June 2022Dear Colleagues,Members of the Business Community,Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,I am glad to attend the BRICS Business Forum, and I wish to extend a warm welcome to all of you.Right now, our world is facing drastic changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century. Various security challenges keep emerging. The world economy still faces strong headwinds on its path toward recovery, and global development has suffered major setbacks. Where is the world headed: Peace or war? Progress or regression? Openness or isolation? Cooperation or confrontation? These are choices of the times that we are confronted with.Human history, like a river, keeps surging forward, with moments of both calm waters and huge waves. Despite changes in an evolving global environment, the historical trend of openness and development will not reverse course, and our shared desire to meet challenges together through cooperation will remain as strong as ever. We should stand high and not allow ourselves to be distracted by fleeting clouds, and we should have a keen appreciation of the law governing the advance of history. We should refuse to be led astray by any turn of events or intimidated by any risk. We should rise to challenge and forge ahead with resolve toward the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind.First, we should embrace solidarity and coordination and jointly maintain world peace and stability. We in China believe that “history, if not forgotten, can serve as a guide for the future”. In the past century, humanity have gone through the scourge of two world wars and the dark shadow of the Cold War. The tragedies of the past tell us that hegemony, group politics and bloc confrontation bring no peace or security; they only lead to wars and conflicts. The Ukraine crisis is another wake-up call for all in the world. It reminds us that blind faith in the so-called “position of strength” and attempts to expand military alliances and seek one’s own security at the expense of others will only land oneself in a security dilemma.History tells us that peace, which is the common cause of humanity, should be pursued and defended by all. Only when we all cherish and uphold peace and never forget the painful lessons of war can there be hope of peace. Facing a volatile and unstable world, we should stay true to the pledge of the UN Charter and fulfill the mission of maintaining peace. Not long ago, I put forward the Global Security Initiative, calling on all countries to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains. We in the international community should reject zero-sum games and jointly oppose hegemonism and power politics. We should build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. We should be clear that we are a community in which all countries share a common stake, and we should see that the light of peace will reach all corners of the world.Second, we should reach out to each other and jointly promote sustainable global development. Development holds the key to solving various difficult problems and delivering better lives to the people. Today, the global development process has hit major roadblocks, the momentum of international development cooperation is being weakened, and development gap between the North and the South keeps widening. As a result, the global efforts to implement the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have suffered major setbacks. Almost 1.2 billion people in nearly 70 countries are confronted with COVID-19, food, energy and debt crises. What has been achieved in decades of global poverty reduction efforts could be lost.Last year, I put forward the Global Development Initiative, and I called on all countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, forge united, equal, balanced and inclusive global development partnership, and promote cooperation in a wide range of areas such as poverty reduction, public health, education, digital connectivity and industrialization. We should deepen cooperation to better safeguard food and energy security. We should seize opportunities presented by the new scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and promote the flow of factors of production that enable innovation globally. We should help developing countries speed up development of the digital economy and green transformation. We should also engage in cooperation on COVID-19 response and provide more anti-COVID medicines to developing countries so as to beat the virus at an early date.In two days, China will host the High-level Dialogue on Global Development to discuss ways to promote global development. We should respond to people’s concerns, pursue the larger interests of all countries, and steer global development to a new era to deliver benefit to all.Third, we should tide over difficulties together and jointly pursue win-win cooperation. At present, some important industrial and supply chains are suffering from deliberate disruptions, commodity prices remain high and are fluctuating, global inflation keeps rising, the international financial market is in turmoil, and global economic recovery is losing steam. People have reason to be concerned that the world economy might slip into a crisis.At this critical juncture, tiding over difficulties together and pursuing cooperation is the only way for us to forestall an economic crisis. We should come together with a united purpose and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination to prevent the slowdown and even halt of the global recovery. Major developed countries should adopt responsible economic policies and avoid negative policy spillovers that may take a heavy toll on developing countries. It has been proved time and again that sanctions are a boomerang and a double-edged sword. To politicize the global economy and turn it into one’s tool or weapon, and willfully impose sanctions by using one’s primary position in the international financial and monetary systems will only end up hurting one’s own interests as well as those of others, and inflict suffering on everyone. Fourth, we should be inclusive and jointly expand openness and integration. The rapid economic globalization that we have seen since the end of the Cold War has greatly boosted the movement of goods and capital and advances in technology and civilization. A more open and inclusive world will create greater development opportunities for all and deliver a more prosperous future for all. For some time, however, economic globalization has faced headwinds and countercurrents. Some countries attempt to decouple with others, sever supply chains and build “a small yard with high fences”. There is widespread concern in the international community that should such a tendency continue, the global economy will become compartmentalized and mutually exclusive. Economic globalization is a response to development of productivity and, as such, represents an unstoppable historical trend. Anyone who attempts to turn back the wheel of history and block others’ way will only have his own path blocked.As an ancient Chinese saying goes, “Constant piling up of earth makes Mount Tai great; ceaseless inflow of rivers makes the ocean deep.” Inclusiveness, shared benefits and win-win outcomes is what we should pursue. We should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness, eliminate all barriers to the development of productivity, and steer globalization in the right direction. This will boost the free flow of capital and technology, unleash the full potential of innovation and creativity, and foster synergy in boosting global economic growth. We should uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, remove barriers to trade, investment and technology, and keep the global economy open. We should promote extensive consultation and joint contribution to deliver shared benefits, enhance global economic governance, and increase the representation and say of emerging markets and developing countries. This will ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights, follow the rules as equals, and share equal opportunities.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,This year, facing a complicated and challenging domestic and international environment for development, China has risen to various challenges and taken well-coordinated steps to respond to COVID-19 and pursue economic and social development. Putting the people and their lives first, China has built a strong line of defense against the virus, and consolidated the gains made in COVID-19 response. Thanks to these efforts, we have protected people’s lives and health and ensured overall stable performance in economic and social development to the maximum extent possible. We will step up macroeconomic policy adjustment, and adopt more forceful measures to deliver the economic and social development goals for the whole year and minimize the impact of COVID-19.In the second half of this year, the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress, which will chart the course for the next phase of China’s development. We will ground our efforts in the new development stage, follow the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm and strive to achieve high-quality development. China will continue to pursue opening-up against higher standards, develop new systems for a higher-standard open economy, and continue to foster a market- and law-based and internationalized business environment. I warmly welcome you to invest and do business in China, strengthen business cooperation with China, and share in China’s development opportunities.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,The BRICS mechanism is an important cooperation platform for emerging markets and developing countries. The business community is a dynamic force driving BRICS’ effective cooperation. Over the years, you in the business communities of BRICS countries have kept exploring new ground, unlocked the potential of cooperation among the five countries, and made important contribution to the development of BRICS countries. Your efforts deserve full recognition.BRICS cooperation has now entered a new stage of high-quality development. I hope that you business leaders will continue to act with tenacity and in a pioneering spirit, and champion open, innovative and shared development so as to add new impetus to BRICS cooperation. You should tap into the complementarity of BRICS countries’ diverse economic structures and resources, upgrade cooperation on trade, investment and finance, expand cooperation on cross-border e-commerce, logistics, local currencies and credit rating, and keep industrial and supply chains safe and unclogged. I hope you will actively participate in building the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution, strengthen cooperation on digital economy, smart manufacturing, clean energy and low-carbon technology, and support the industrial restructuring and upgrading in BRICS countries. I hope you will advance cooperation on energy, food, infrastructure and skill training, fulfill your social responsibilities, and see that more benefits of development will reach everyone in a more equitable way.I am convinced that as long as we hoist high the sail of mutual benefit and win-win and keep a steady hand on the tiller of solidarity and cooperation, we will break waves and steer the giant ship of BRICS countries toward a brighter future!To conclude, I wish the BRICS Business Forum a full success!Thank you.
                

                Opening Address by H.E. Wang YiState Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of ChinaAt the 78th Session of ESCAPMr. Chair,Madam Executive Secretary,Friends,On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Commission, I am delighted to join you today in reviewing the extraordinary journey of ESCAP and envisioning the future of the Asia-Pacific region.Seventy-five years ago, ESCAP was born in Shanghai, China in response to the eager aspirations of the Asia-Pacific people for a better life amid war, poverty and hunger.The 75 years since have been fruitful. The Asia-Pacific has been peaceful and stable on the whole. With dynamic regional cooperation and fast growing economic strength, the region has created the “Asia-Pacific miracle” admired across the world, leaving a spectacular chapter in its history. None of these has come easily, and should therefore be cherished and guarded by all Asia-Pacific countries.Seventy-five years later today, the world is faced with profound changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century. The dregs of the Cold War mentality are resurfacing, and unilateralism is running rampant, gravely upsetting the international order. Once again the Asia-Pacific region stands at another historical crossroads.China believes that under the new circumstances, the Asia-Pacific has assumed a more important place in the world and has a greater role to play. Its peace and prosperity concerns not only its own future, but also that of the world. The concept of Asia-Pacific should not be diluted, and Asia-Pacific cooperation should not be disrupted. We must learn from history and forge ahead to build together an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and take Asia-Pacific cooperation to new heights.First, we need to unswervingly maintain peace and stability. We need to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, abandon the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism and reject any attempt to bring military groups and bloc confrontation to the Asia-Pacific. It is important that we pursue the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and pay attention to the legitimate security concerns of all countries. No one should base its security on the insecurity of other countries. Disputes should be resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation. We need to support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, and oppose all words and actions that inflate tensions and stoke confrontation in the region.Second, we need to jointly promote economic development. While tackling the impact of the pandemic together, we need to speed up integrated development of the region, promote the establishment of an Asia-Pacific FTA, and build an open Asia-Pacific economy featuring equal consultation, joint participation and shared benefits. We should uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime, keep global industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded, and strive for an open world economy, so as to offer more “Asia-Pacific opportunities” for global economic recovery and growth.Third, we need to combine our respective strengths for win-win cooperation. The great diversity and rich resources mean vast potential for cooperation among Asia-Pacific countries. We need to further coordinate our development policies, use our respective strengths and deepen practical cooperation in the areas of poverty reduction, food security, COVID control, green development and digital economy. Forging greater synergy, we will make Asia-Pacific contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,The Asia-Pacific is home to China. We will continue to keep in mind and strive for the interest of the Asia-Pacific, and take real actions to contribute more to the long-term peace and security and sustainable development in the region.China will firmly safeguard peace in the Asia-Pacific. With humanity’s security and well-being in his mind, President Xi Jinping has recently proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI), contributing China’s wisdom to the settlement of international security issues. We will step up dialogue and cooperation with other Asia-Pacific countries to make this important initiative deliver. China will keep to the Chinese way of resolving hotspot issues, and actively promote political settlement of Afghanistan, the Iranian nuclear issue, the Korean Peninsula and other issues. China is ready to speed up consultations with ASEAN countries for an early conclusion of a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), which will provide solid safeguards for managing differences, advancing cooperation and promoting joint governance in the South China Sea.China will firmly promote development in the Asia-Pacific. While expanding high-level opening-up, China is striving to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, facilitate connectivity in the Asia-Pacific, and ensure safe and stable functioning of industrial and supply chains in the region. We will work with other countries to fully implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and actively promote the process of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).China will remain firm in participating in Asia-Pacific cooperation. The Global Development Initiative (GDI), proposed by President Xi Jinping, accords with the historical trend and meets the needs of various countries. It will bring new impetus to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the Asia-Pacific. China will hold a high-level meeting on global development at a proper time, scale up support in financing, and establish a pool of GDI projects participated by all parties.China will firmly support the work of ESCAP. We will communicate and coordinate more closely with the UN system and the ESCAP Secretariat. We will work with other ESCAP members to ensure effective implementation of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement, the Trans-Asian Railway and other key projects, and further contribute to the China-ESCAP Cooperation Program for ESCAP to play a bigger role in advancing regional development.I wish the ESCAP Session a full success!
